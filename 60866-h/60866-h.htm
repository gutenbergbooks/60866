<p class='c011'>From Bocca di Magra to Bocca d’Arno,
mile after mile, the sandy beaches
smoothly, unbrokenly extend. Inland from
the beach, behind a sheltering belt of pines,
lies a strip of coastal plain—flat as a slice
of Holland and dyked with slow streams.
Corn grows here and the vine, with plantations
of slim poplars interspersed, and fat
water-meadows. Here and there the streams
brim over into shallow lakes, whose shores
are fringed with sodden fields of rice. And
behind this strip of plain, four or five miles
from the sea, the mountains rise, suddenly
and steeply: the Apuan Alps. Their highest
crests are of bare limestone, streaked here
and there with the white marble which brings
prosperity to the little towns that stand at
their feet: Massa and Carrara, Serravezza,
Pietrasanta. Half the world’s tombstones
are scooped out of these noble crags. Their
lower slopes are grey with olive trees, green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>with woods of chestnut. Over their summits
repose the enormous sculptured masses
of the clouds.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The landscape fairly quotes Shelley at you.
This sea with its luminous calms and sudden
tempests, these dim blue islands hull
down on the horizon, these mountains and
their marvellous clouds, these rivers and
woodlands are the very substance of his
poetry. Live on this coast for a little and
you will find yourself constantly thinking of
that lovely, that strangely childish poetry,
that beautiful and child-like man. Perhaps
his spirit haunts the coast. It was in this
sea that he sailed his flimsy boat, steering
with one hand and holding in the other his
little volume of Æschylus. You picture him
so on the days of calm. And on the days
of sudden violent storm you think of him,
too. The lightnings cut across the sky, the
thunders are like terrible explosions overhead,
the squall comes down with a fury.
What news of the flimsy boat? None, save
only that a few days after the storm a young
body is washed ashore, battered, unrecognizable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the little Æschylus in the coat pocket
is all that tells us that this was Shelley.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have been spending the summer on this
haunted coast. That must be my excuse for
mentioning in so self-absorbed a world as is
ours the name of a poet who has been dead
these hundred years. But be reassured. I
have no intention of writing an article about
the ineffectual angel beating in the void his
something-or-other wings in vain. I do not
mean to add my croak to the mellifluous
chorus of centenary-celebrators. No; the
ghost of Shelley, who walks in Versilia and
the Lunigia, by the shores of the Gulf of
Spezia and below Pisa where Arno disembogues,
this ghost with whom I have shaken
hands and talked, incites me, not to add a
supererogatory and impertinent encomium,
but rather to protest against the outpourings
of the other encomiasts, of the honey-voiced
centenary-chanters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cooing of these persons, ordinarily a
specific against insomnia, is in this case an
irritant; it rouses, it exacerbates. For annoying
and disgusting it certainly is, this
spectacle of a rebellious youth praised to
fulsomeness, a hundred years after his death,
by people who would hate him and be horrified
by him, if he were alive, as much as
the Scotch reviewers hated and were horrified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>by Shelley. How would these persons
treat a young contemporary who, not content
with being a literary innovator, should
use his talent to assault religion and the established
order, should blaspheme against
plutocracy and patriotism, should proclaim
himself a Bolshevik, an internationalist, a
pacifist, a conscientious objector? They
would say of him that he was a dangerous
young man who ought to be put in his place;
and they would either disparage and denigrate
his talent, or else—if they were a little
more subtly respectable—they would
never allow his name to get into print in
any of the periodicals which they controlled.
But seeing that Shelley was safely burnt on
the sands of Viareggio a hundred years ago,
seeing that he is no longer a live dangerous
man but only a dead classic, these respectable
supporters of established literature and established
society join in chorus to praise him,
and explain his meaning, and preach sermons
over him. The mellifluous cooing is accompanied
by a snuffle, and there hangs over
these centenary celebrations a genial miasma
of hypocrisy and insincerity. The effect of
these festal anniversaries in England is not
to rekindle life in the great dead; a centenary
is rather a second burial, a reaffirmation of
deadness. A spirit that was once alive is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>fossilized and, in the midst of solemn and
funereal ceremonies, the petrified classic is
duly niched in the temple of respectability.</p>

<p class='c013'>How much better they order these things
in Italy! In that country—which one must
ever admire more the more one sees of it—they
duly celebrate their great men; but celebrate
them not with a snuffle, not in black
clothes, not with prayer-books in their hands,
crape round their hats and a hatred, in their
hearts, of all that has to do with life and
vigour. No, no; they make their dead an
excuse for quickening life among the living;
they get fun out of their centenaries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Last year the Italians were celebrating the
six hundredth anniversary of Dante’s death.
Now, imagine what this celebration would
have been like in England. All the oldest
critics and all the young men who aspire to
be old would have written long articles in
all the literary papers. That would have set
the tone. After that some noble lord, or even
a Prince of the Blood, would have unveiled
a monument designed by Frampton or some
other monumental mason of the Academy.
Imbecile speeches in words of not more than
two syllables would then have been pronounced
over the ashes of the world’s most
intelligent poet. To his intelligence no reference
would, of course, be made; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>character, ah! his character would get a
glowing press. The most fiery and bitter of
men would be held up as an example to all
Sunday-school children.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this display of reverence, we should
have had a lovely historical pageant in the
rain. A young female dressed in white bunting
would have represented Beatrice, and for
the Poet himself some actor manager with
a profile and a voice would have been found.
Guelfs and Ghibellines in fancy dress of the
period would go splashing about in the mud,
and a great many verses by Louis Napoleon
Parker would be declaimed. And at the end
we should all go home with colds in our
heads and suffering from septic ennui, but
with, at the same time, a pleasant feeling of
virtuousness, as though we had been at
church.</p>

<p class='c013'>See now what happens in Italy. The principal
event in the Dante celebration is an
enormous military review. Hundreds of
thousands of wiry little brown men parade
the streets of Florence. Young officers of a
fabulous elegance clank along in superbly
tailored riding breeches and glittering top-boots.
The whole female population palpitates.
It is an excellent beginning.
Speeches are then made, as only in Italy
they can be made—round, rumbling, sonorous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>speeches, all about Dante the Italianissimous
poet, Dante the irredentist, Dante
the prophet of Greater Italy, Dante the
scourge of Jugo-Slavs and Serbs. Immense
enthusiasm. Never having read a line of
his works, we feel that Dante is our personal
friend, a brother Fascist.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that the real fun begins; we have
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">manifestazioni sportive</span></i> of the centenary
celebrations. Innumerable bicycle races are
organized. Fierce young Fascisti with the
faces of Roman heroes pay their homage
to the Poet by doing a hundred and eighty
kilometres to the hour round the Circuit of
Milan. High speed Fiats and Ansaldos and
Lancias race one another across the Apennines
and round the bastions of the Alps.
Pigeons are shot, horses gallop, football is
played under the broiling sun. Long live
Dante!</p>

<p class='c013'>How infinitely preferable this is to the
stuffiness and the snuffle of an English centenary!
Poetry, after all, is life, not death.
Bicycle races may not have very much to
do with Dante—though I can fancy him, his
thin face set like metal, whizzing down the
spirals of Hell on a pair of twinkling wheels
or climbing laboriously the one-in-three
gradients of Purgatory Mountain on the
back of his trusty Sunbeam. No, they may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not have much to do with Dante; but
pageants in Anglican cathedral closes, boring
articles by old men who would hate and
fear him if he were alive, speeches by noble
lords over monuments made by Royal
Academicians—these, surely, have even less
to do with the author of the <i>Inferno</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not merely their great dead whom the
Italians celebrate in this gloriously living
fashion. Even their religious festivals have
the same jovial warm-blooded character.
This summer, for example, a great feast took
place at Loreto to celebrate the arrival of a
new image of the Virgin to replace the old
one which was burnt some little while ago.
The excitement started in Rome, where the
image, after being blessed by the Pope, was
taken in a motor-car to the station amid
cheering crowds who shouted, “Evviva
Maria” as the Fiat and its sacred burden
rolled past. The arrival of the Virgin in
Loreto was the signal for a tremendous outburst
of jollification. The usual bicycle
races took place; there were football matches
and pigeon-shooting competitions and
Olympic games. The fun lasted for days.
At the end of the festivities two cardinals
went up in aeroplanes and blessed the assembled
multitudes—an incident of which the
Pope is said to have remarked that the blessing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in this case, did indeed come from
heaven.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rare people! If only we Anglo-Saxons
could borrow from the Italians some of their
realism, their love of life for its own sake,
of palpable, solid, immediate things. In this
dim land of ours we are accustomed to pay
too much respect to fictitious values; we worship
invisibilities and in our enjoyment of
immediate life we are restrained by imaginary
inhibitions. We think too much of the
past, of metaphysics, of tradition, of the
ideal future, of decorum and good form; too
little of life and the glittering noisy moment.
The Italians are born Futurists. It did not
need Marinetti to persuade them to celebrate
Dante with bicycle races; they would have
done it naturally, spontaneously, if no Futurist
propaganda had ever been issued.
Marinetti is the product of modern Italy, not
modern Italy of Marinetti. They are all
Futurists in that burningly living Italy where
we from the North seek only an escape into
the past. Or rather, they are not Futurists:
Marinetti’s label was badly chosen. They
are Presentists. The early Christians preoccupied
with nothing but the welfare of their
souls in the life to come were Futurists, if
you like.</p>

<p class='c013'>We shall do well to learn something of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>their lively Presentism. Let us hope that our
great-grandchildren will celebrate the next
centenary of Shelley’s death by aerial regattas
and hydroplane races. The living will
be amused and the dead worthily commemorated.
The spirit of the man who delighted,
during life, in wind and clouds, in mountain-tops
and waters, in the flight of birds and the
gliding of ships, will be rejoiced when young
men celebrate his memory by flying through
the air or skimming, like alighting swans,
over the surface of the sea.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='2'>II</abbr>: ON RE-READING <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CANDIDE</span></i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The furniture vans had unloaded their
freight in the new house. We were
installed, or, at least, we were left to make
the best of an unbearable life in the dirt and
the confusion. One of the Pre-Raphaelites,
I forget at the moment which, once painted
a picture called “The Last Day in the Old
Home.” A touching subject. But it would
need a grimmer, harder brush to depict the
horrors of “The First Day in the New
Home.” I had sat down in despair among
the tumbled movables when I noticed—with
what a thrill of pleased recognition—the top
of a little leather-bound book protruding
from among a mass of bulkier volumes in an
uncovered case. It was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Candide</span></i>, my treasured
little first edition of 1759, with its discreetly
ridiculous title-page, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Candide ou
L’Optimisme</i>, Traduit de l’Allemand de Mr.
le Docteur Ralph.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>Optimism—I had need of a little at the
moment, and as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mr. le Docteur Ralph</span> is
notoriously one of the preachers most capable
of inspiring it, I took up the volume and
began to read: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y avait en Westphalie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>dans le Château de Mr. le Baron de Thunder-ten-tronckh....</span>”
I did not put down
the volume till I had reached the final: “Il
faut cultiver notre jardin.” I felt the wiser
and the more cheerful for Doctor Ralph’s
ministrations.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the remarkable thing about re-reading
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Candide</span></i> is not that the book amuses one, not
that it delights and astonishes with its brilliance;
that is only to be expected. No, it
evokes a new and, for me at least, an unanticipated
emotion. In the good old days,
before the Flood, the history of Candide’s
adventures seemed to us quiet, sheltered,
middle-class people only a delightful phantasy,
or at best a high-spirited exaggeration
of conditions which we knew, vaguely and
theoretically, to exist, to have existed, a long
way off in space and time. But read the
book to-day; you feel yourself entirely at
home in its pages. It is like reading a record
of the facts and opinions of 1922; nothing
was ever more applicable, more completely
to the point. The world in which we
live is recognizably the world of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Candide</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cunégonde</span>, of Martin and the Old
Woman who was a Pope’s daughter and the
betrothed of the sovereign Prince of Massa-Carrara.
The only difference is that the
horrors crowd rather more thickly on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>world of 1922 than they did on Candide’s
world. The manœuvrings of Bulgare and
Abare, the intestine strife in Morocco, the
earthquake and <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">auto-da-fé</span></i> are but pale poor
things compared with the Great War, the
Russian Famine, the Black and Tans, the
Fascisti, and all the other horrors of which
we can proudly boast. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand Sa Hautesse
envoye un vaisseau en Egypte,</span>” remarked
the Dervish, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s’embarrasse-t-elle si les souris
qui sont dans le vaisseau sont à leur aise ou
non?</span>” No; but there are moments when
Sa Hautesse, absent-mindedly no doubt, lets
fall into the hold of the vessel a few dozen
of hungry cats; the present seems to be one
of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cats in the hold? There is nothing in
that to be surprised at. The wisdom of Martin
and the Old Woman who was once betrothed
to the Prince of Massa-Carrara has
become the everyday wisdom of all the
world since 1914. In the happy Victorian
and Edwardian past, Western Europe, like
Candide, was surprised at everything. It
was amazed by the frightful conduct of King
Bomba, amazed by the Turks, amazed by
the political chicanery and loose morals of
the Second Empire—(what is all Zola but
a prolonged exclamation of astonishment at
the goings-on of his contemporaries?).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>After that we were amazed at the disgusting
behaviour of the Boers, while the rest of
Europe was amazed at ours. There followed
the widespread astonishment that in this, the
so-called twentieth century, black men
should be treated as they were being treated
on the Congo and the Amazon. Then came
the war: a great outburst of indignant astonishment,
and afterwards an acquiescence as
complete, as calmly cynical as Martin’s. For
we have discovered, in the course of the
somewhat excessively prolonged <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">histoire à la
Candide</span></i> of the last seven years, that astonishment
is a supererogatory emotion. All
things are possible, not merely for Providence,
whose ways we had always known,
albeit for some time rather theoretically, to
be strange, but also for men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men, we thought, had grown up from the
brutal and rampageous hobbledehoyism of
earlier ages and were now as polite and genteel
as Gibbon himself. We now know better.
Create a hobbledehoy environment and
you will have hobbledehoy behaviour; create
a Gibbonish environment and every one will
be, more or less, genteel. It seems obvious,
now. And now that we are living in a hobbledehoy
world, we have learnt Martin’s lesson
so well that we can look on almost unmoved
at the most appalling natural catastrophes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and at exhibitions of human stupidity
and wickedness which would have aroused
us in the past to surprise and indignation.
Indeed, we have left Martin behind and are
become, with regard to many things, Pococurante.</p>

<p class='c013'>And what is the remedy? <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mr. le Docteur
Ralph</span> would have us believe that it consists
in the patient cultivation of our gardens.
He is probably right. The only trouble is
that the gardens of some of us seem hardly
worth cultivating. The garden of the bank
clerk and the factory hand, the shop-girl’s
garden, the garden of the civil servant and
the politician—can one cultivate them with
much enthusiasm? Or, again, there is my
garden, the garden of literary journalism.
In this little plot I dig and delve, plant,
prune, and finally reap—sparsely enough,
goodness knows!—from one year’s end to another.
And to what purpose, to whom for a
good, as the Latin Grammar would say? Ah,
there you have me.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a passage in one of Tchekov’s letters
which all literary journalists should inscribe
in letters of gold upon their writing
desks. “I send you,” says Tchekov to his
correspondent, “Mihailovsky’s article on
Tolstoy.... It’s a good article, but it’s
strange: one might write a thousand such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>articles and things would not be one step
forwarder, and it would still remain unintelligible
why such articles are written.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut cultiver notre jardin.</span></i> Yes, but
suppose one begins to wonder why?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='3'>III</abbr>: ACCIDIE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The cœnobites of the Thebaid were subjected
to the assaults of many demons.
Most of these evil spirits came furtively with
the coming of night. But there was one, a
fiend of deadly subtlety, who was not afraid
to walk by day. The holy men of the desert
called him the <i>dæmon meridianus</i>; for his
favourite hour of visitation was in the heat
of the day. He would lie in wait for monks
grown weary with working in the oppressive
heat, seizing a moment of weakness to force
an entrance into their hearts. And once installed
there, what havoc he wrought! For
suddenly it would seem to the poor victim
that the day was intolerably long and life
desolatingly empty. He would go to the
door of his cell and look up at the sun and
ask himself if a new Joshua had arrested it
midway up the heavens. Then he would go
back into the shade and wonder what good
he was doing in that cell or if there was any
object in existence. Then he would look at
the sun again and find it indubitably stationary,
and the hour of the communal repast of
the evening as remote as ever. And he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>go back to his meditations, to sink, sink
through disgust and lassitude into the black
depths of despair and hopeless unbelief.
When that happened the demon smiled and
took his departure, conscious that he had
done a good morning’s work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Throughout the Middle Ages this demon
was known as Acedia, or, in English, Accidie.
Monks were still his favourite victims, but
he made many conquests among the laity
also. Along with <i>gastrimargia</i>, <i>fornicatio</i>,
<i>philargyria</i>, <i>tristitia</i>, <i>cenodoxia</i>, <i>ira</i> and <i>superbia</i>,
<i>acedia</i> or <i>tædium cordis</i> is reckoned
as one of the eight principal vices to which
man is subject. Inaccurate psychologists of
evil are wont to speak of accidie as though
it were plain sloth. But sloth is only one of
the numerous manifestations of the subtle
and complicated vice of accidie. Chaucer’s
discourse on it in the “Parson’s Tale” contains
a very precise description of this disastrous
vice of the spirit. “Accidie,” he tells
us, “makith a man hevy, thoghtful and
wrawe.” It paralyzes human will, “it forsloweth
and forsluggeth” a man whenever
he attempts to act. From accidie comes
dread to begin to work any good deeds, and
finally wanhope, or despair. On its way to
ultimate wanhope, accidie produces a whole
crop of minor sins, such as idleness, tardiness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lâchesse</span></i>, coldness, undevotion and “the
synne of worldly sorrow, such as is cleped
<i>tristitia</i>, that sleth man, as seith seint Poule.”
Those who have sinned by accidie find their
everlasting home in the fifth circle of the
Inferno. They are plunged in the same black
bog with the Wrathful, and their sobs and
words come bubbling up to the surface:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Accidie did not disappear with the monasteries
and the Middle Ages. The Renaissance
was also subject to it. We find a copious
description of the symptoms of acedia
in Burton’s <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>. The
results of the midday demon’s machinations
are now known as the vapours or the spleen.
To the spleen amiable Mr. Matthew Green,
of the Custom House, devoted those eight
hundred octosyllables which are his claim to
immortality. For him it is a mere disease
to be healed by temperate diet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'>Hail! water gruel, healing power,</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>by laughter, reading and the company of unaffected
young ladies:</p>

      <div class='line'>Nor lay out so much cost and art</div>
      <div class='line'>But to deflower the virgin heart;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>by the avoidance of party passion, drink,
Dissenters and missionaries, especially missionaries:
to whose undertakings Mr. Green
always declined to subscribe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I laugh off spleen and keep my pence</div>
      <div class='line'>From spoiling Indian innocence;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>by refraining from going to law, writing
poetry and thinking about one’s future state.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>The Spleen</i> was published in the thirties
of the eighteenth century. Accidie was still,
if not a sin, at least a disease. But a change
was at hand. “The sin of worldly sorrow,
such as is cleped <i>tristitia</i>,” became a literary
virtue, a spiritual mode. The apostles of
melancholy wound their faint horns, and the
Men of Feeling wept. Then came the nineteenth
century and romanticism; and with
them the triumph of the meridian demon.
Accidie in its most complicated and most
deadly form, a mixture of boredom, sorrow
and despair, was now an inspiration to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>greatest poets and novelists, and it has remained
so to this day. The Romantics called
this horrible phenomenon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</span></i>.
But the name made no difference; the thing
was still the same. The meridian demon had
good cause to be satisfied during the nineteenth
century, for it was then, as Baudelaire
puts it, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Ennui, fruit de la morne incuriosité,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prit les proportions de l’immortalité.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is a very curious phenomenon, this
progress of accidie from the position of being
a deadly sin, deserving of damnation, to the
position first of a disease and finally of an
essentially lyrical emotion, fruitful in the
inspiration of much of the most characteristic
modern literature. The sense of universal
futility, the feelings of boredom and
despair, with the complementary desire to be
“anywhere, anywhere out of the world,” or
at least out of the place in which one happens
at the moment to be, have been the inspiration
of poetry and the novel for a century
and more. It would have been inconceivable
in Matthew Green’s day to have
written a serious poem about ennui. By
Baudelaire’s time ennui was as suitable a
subject for lyric poetry as love; and accidie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>is still with us as an inspiration, one of the
most serious and poignant of literary themes.
What is the significance of this fact? For
clearly the progress of accidie is a spiritual
event of considerable importance. How is
it to be explained?</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not as though the nineteenth century
invented accidie. Boredom, hopelessness and
despair have always existed, and have been
felt as poignantly in the past as we feel
them now. Something has happened to
make these emotions respectable and avowable;
they are no longer sinful, no longer
regarded as the mere symptoms of disease.
That something that has happened is surely
simply history since 1789. The failure of
the French Revolution and the more spectacular
downfall of Napoleon planted accidie
in the heart of every youth of the Romantic
generation—and not in France alone, but all
over Europe—who believed in liberty or
whose adolescence had been intoxicated by
the ideas of glory and genius. Then came industrial
progress with its prodigious multiplication
of filth, misery, and ill-gotten
wealth; the defilement of nature by modern
industry was in itself enough to sadden many
sensitive minds. The discovery that political
enfranchisement, so long and stubbornly
fought for, was the merest futility and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>vanity so long as industrial servitude remained
in force was another of the century’s
horrible disillusionments.</p>

<p class='c013'>A more subtle cause of the prevalence of
boredom was the disproportionate growth of
the great towns. Habituated to the feverish
existence of these few centres of activity,
men found that life outside them was intolerably
insipid. And at the same time
they became so much exhausted by the restlessness
of city life that they pined for the
monotonous boredom of the provinces, for
exotic islands, even for other worlds—any
haven of rest. And finally, to crown this
vast structure of failures and disillusionments,
there came the appalling catastrophe
of the War of 1914. Other epochs have witnessed
disasters, have had to suffer disillusionment;
but in no century have the disillusionments
followed on one another’s
heels with such unintermitted rapidity as in
the twentieth, for the good reason that in
no century has change been so rapid and so
profound. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal du siècle</span></i> was an inevitable
evil; indeed, we can claim with a certain
pride that we have a right to our accidie.
With us it is not a sin or a disease of the
hypochondries; it is a state of mind which
fate has forced upon us.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>: SUBJECT-MATTER OF POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It should theoretically be possible to make
poetry out of anything whatsoever of
which the spirit of man can take cognizance.
We find, however, as a matter of historical
fact, that most of the world’s best poetry has
been content with a curiously narrow range
of subject-matter. The poets have claimed
as their domain only a small province
of our universe. One of them now and
then, more daring or better equipped than
the rest, sets out to extend the boundaries
of the kingdom. But for the most part the
poets do not concern themselves with fresh
conquests; they prefer to consolidate their
power at home, enjoying quietly their hereditary
possessions. All the world is potentially
theirs, but they do not take it. What
is the reason for this, and why is it that
poetical practice does not conform to critical
theory? The problem has a peculiar relevance
and importance in these days, when
young poetry claims absolute liberty to speak
how it likes of whatsoever it pleases.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wordsworth, whose literary criticism, dry
and forbidding though its aspect may be, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>always illumined by a penetrating intelligence,
Wordsworth touched upon this problem
in his preface to <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>—touched
on it and, as usual, had something
of value to say about it. He is speaking here
of the most important and the most interesting
of the subjects which may, theoretically,
be made into poetry, but which have, as a
matter of fact, rarely or never undergone the
transmutation: he is speaking of the relations
between poetry and that vast world of abstractions
and ideas—science and philosophy—into
which so few poets have ever penetrated.
“The remotest discoveries of the
chemist, the botanist, or mineralogist, will
be as proper objects of the poet’s art as any
upon which he is now employed, if the time
should ever come when these things shall be
familiar to us, and the relations under which
they are contemplated shall be manifestly
and palpably material to us as enjoying and
suffering beings.” It is a formidable sentence;
but read it well, read the rest of the
passage from which it is taken, and you will
find it to be full of critical truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gist of Wordsworth’s argument is
this. All subjects—“the remotest discoveries
of the chemist” are but one example of
an unlikely poetic theme—can serve the poet
with material for his art, on one condition:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that he, and to a lesser degree his audience,
shall be able to apprehend the subject with a
certain emotion. The subject must somehow
be involved in the poet’s intimate being before
he can turn it into poetry. It is not
enough, for example, that he should apprehend
it merely through his senses. (The
poetry of pure sensation, of sounds and
bright colours, is common enough nowadays;
but amusing as we may find it for the moment,
it cannot hold the interest for long.)
It is not enough, at the other end of the
scale, if he apprehends his subject in a purely
intellectual manner. An abstract idea must
be felt with a kind of passion, it must mean
something emotionally significant, it must
be as immediate and important to the poet
as a personal relationship before he can
make poetry of it. Poetry, in a word, must
be written by “enjoying and suffering beings,”
not by beings exclusively dowered
with sensations or, as exclusively, with intellect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wordsworth’s criticism helps us to understand
why so few subjects have ever been
made into poetry when everything under the
sun, and beyond it, is theoretically suitable
for transmutation into a work of art. Death,
love, religion, nature; the primary emotions
and the ultimate personal mysteries—these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>form the subject-matter of most of the greatest
poetry. And for obvious reasons. These
things are “manifestly and palpably material
to us as enjoying and suffering beings.”
But to most men, including the generality of
poets, abstractions and ideas are not immediately
and passionately moving. They are
not enjoying or suffering when they apprehend
these things—only thinking.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men who do feel passionately about
abstractions, the men to whom ideas are as
persons—moving and disquietingly alive—are
very seldom poets. They are men of
science and philosophers, preoccupied with
the search for truth and not, like the poet,
with the expression and creation of beauty.
It is very rarely that we find a poet who
combines the power and the desire to express
himself with that passionate apprehension of
ideas and that passionate curiosity about
strange remote facts which characterize the
man of science and the philosopher. If he
possessed the requisite sense of language and
the impelling desire to express himself in
terms of beauty, Einstein could write the
most intoxicating lyrics about relativity and
the pleasures of pure mathematics. And if,
say, Mr. Yeats understood the Einstein theory—which,
in company with most other
living poets, he presumably does not, any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>more than the rest of us—if he apprehended
it exultingly as something bold and profound,
something vitally important and marvellously
true, he too could give us, out of
the Celtic twilight, his lyrics of relativity.
It is those distressing little “ifs” that stand
in the way of this happy consummation.
The conditions upon which any but the most
immediately and obviously moving subjects
can be made into poetry are so rarely fulfilled,
the combination of poet and man of
science, poet and philosopher, is so uncommon,
that the theoretical universality of the
art has only very occasionally been realized
in practice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Contemporary poetry in the whole of the
western world is insisting, loudly and emphatically
through the mouths of its propagandists,
on an absolute liberty to speak
of what it likes how it likes. Nothing could
be better; all that we can now ask is that the
poets should put the theory into practice, and
that they should make use of the liberty
which they claim by enlarging the bounds of
poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>The propagandists would have us believe
that the subject-matter of contemporary
poetry is new and startling, that modern
poets are doing something which has not been
done before. “Most of the poets represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in these pages,” writes Mr. Louis Untermeyer
in his <i>Anthology of Modern American
Poetry</i>, “have found a fresh and vigorous
material in a world of honest and often harsh
reality. They respond to the spirit of their
times; not only have their views changed,
their vision has been widened to include
things unknown to the poets of yesterday.
They have learned to distinguish real beauty
from mere prettiness, to wring loveliness out
of squalor, to find wonder in neglected places,
to search for hidden truths even in the dark
caves of the unconscious.” Translated into
practice this means that contemporary poets
can now write, in the words of Mr. Sandburg,
of the “harr and boom of the blast
fires,” of “wops and bohunks.” It means, in
fact, that they are at liberty to do what
Homer did—to write freely about the immediately
moving facts of everyday life.
Where Homer wrote of horses and the tamers
of horses, our contemporaries write of
trains, automobiles, and the various species
of wops and bohunks who control the horsepower.
That is all. Much too much stress
has been laid on the newness of the new
poetry; its newness is simply a return from
the jewelled exquisiteness of the eighteen-nineties
to the facts and feelings of ordinary
life. There is nothing intrinsically novel or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>surprising in the introduction into poetry of
machinery and industrialism, of labour unrest
and modern psychology: these things belong
to us, they affect us daily as enjoying
and suffering beings; they are a part of our
lives, just as the kings, the warriors, the
horses and chariots, the picturesque mythology
were part of Homer’s life. The subject-matter
of the new poetry remains the same
as that of the old. The old boundaries have
not been extended. There would be real
novelty in the new poetry if it had, for example,
taken to itself any of the new ideas
and astonishing facts with which the new
science has endowed the modern world.
There would be real novelty in it if it had
worked out a satisfactory artistic method for
dealing with abstractions. It has not.
Which simply means that that rare phenomenon,
the poet in whose mind ideas are a
passion and a personal moving force, does
not happen to have appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>And how rarely in all the long past he
has appeared! There was Lucretius, the
greatest of all the philosophic and scientific
poets. In him the passionate apprehension
of ideas, and the desire and ability to give
them expression, combined to produce that
strange and beautiful epic of thought which
is without parallel in the whole history of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>literature. There was Dante, in whose soul
the mediæval Christian philosophy was a
force that shaped and directed every feeling,
thought and action. There was Goethe, who
focussed into beautiful expression an enormous
diffusion of knowledge and ideas. And
there the list of the great poets of thought
comes to an end. In their task of extending
the boundaries of poetry into the remote and
abstract world of ideas, they have had a few
lesser assistants—Donne, for example, a poet
only just less than the greatest; Fulke Greville,
that strange, dark-spirited Elizabethan;
John Davidson, who made a kind
of poetry out of Darwinism; and, most interesting
poetical interpreter of nineteenth-century
science, Jules Laforgue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Which of our contemporaries can claim to
have extended the bounds of poetry to any
material extent? It is not enough to have
written about locomotives and telephones,
“wops and bohunks,” and all the rest of it.
That is not extending the range of poetry;
it is merely asserting its right to deal with
the immediate facts of contemporary life, as
Homer and as Chaucer did. The critics who
would have us believe that there is something
essentially unpoetical about a bohunk (whatever
a Bohunk may be), and something essentially
poetical about Sir Lancelot of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Lake, are, of course, simply negligible; they
may be dismissed as contemptuously as we
have dismissed the pseudo-classical critics
who opposed the freedoms of the Romantic
Revival. And the critics who think it very
new and splendid to bring bohunks into
poetry are equally old-fashioned in their
ideas.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will not be unprofitable to compare the
literary situation in this early twentieth century
of ours with the literary situation of the
early seventeenth century. In both epochs we
see a reaction against a rich and somewhat
formalized poetical tradition expressing itself
in a determination to extend the range of
subject-matter, to get back to real life, and
to use more natural forms of expression. The
difference between the two epochs lies in the
fact that the twentieth-century revolution
has been the product of a number of minor
poets, none of them quite powerful enough
to achieve what he theoretically meant to do,
while the seventeenth-century revolution
was the work of a single poet of genius, John
Donne. Donne substituted for the rich
formalism of non-dramatic Elizabethan poetry
a completely realized new style, the
style of the so-called metaphysical poetry of
the seventeenth century. He was a poet-philosopher-man-of-action
whose passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>curiosity about facts enabled him to make
poetry out of the most unlikely aspects of
material life, and whose passionate apprehension
of ideas enabled him to extend the
bounds of poetry beyond the frontiers of
common life and its emotions into the void
of intellectual abstraction. He put the whole
life and the whole mind of his age into
poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>We to-day are metaphysicals without our
Donne. Theoretically we are free to make
poetry of everything in the universe; in practice
we are kept within the old limits, for the
simple reason that no great man has appeared
to show us how we can use our freedom. A
certain amount of the life of the twentieth
century is to be found in our poetry, but
precious little of its mind. We have no poet
to-day like that strange old Dean of St.
Paul’s three hundred years ago—no poet who
can skip from the heights of scholastic philosophy
to the heights of carnal passion, from
the contemplation of divinity to the contemplation
of a flea, from the rapt examination
of self to an enumeration of the most remote
external facts of science, and make all, by
his strangely passionate apprehension, into
an intensely lyrical poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>The few poets who do try to make of contemporary
ideas the substance of their poetry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>do it in a manner which brings little conviction
or satisfaction to the reader. There is
Mr. Noyes, who is writing four volumes of
verse about the human side of science—in his
case, alas, all too human. Then there is Mr.
Conrad Aiken. He perhaps is the most successful
exponent in <a id='tnpoety'></a>poetry of contemporary
ideas. In his case, it is clear, “the remotest
discoveries of the chemist” are apprehended
with a certain passion; all his emotions are
tinged by his ideas. The trouble with Mr.
Aiken is that his emotions are apt to degenerate
into a kind of intellectual sentimentality,
which expresses itself only too easily in
his prodigiously fluent, highly coloured verse.</p>

<p class='c013'>One could lengthen the list of more or
less interesting poets who have tried in recent
times to extend the boundaries of their
art. But one would not find among them a
single poet of real importance, not one great
or outstanding personality. The twentieth
century still awaits its Lucretius, awaits its
own philosophical Dante, its new Goethe, its
Donne, even its up-to-date Laforgue. Will
they appear? Or are we to go on producing
a poetry in which there is no more than the
dimmest reflection of that busy and incessant
intellectual life which is the characteristic
and distinguishing mark of this age?</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='5'>V</abbr>: WATER MUSIC</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The house in which I live is haunted by
the noise of dripping water. Always,
day and night, summer and winter, something
is dripping somewhere. For many
months an unquiet cistern kept up within its
iron bosom a long, hollow-toned soliloquy.
Now it is mute; but a new and more formidable
drip has come into existence. From the
very summit of the house a little spout—the
overflow, no doubt, of some unknown receptacle
under the roof—lets fall a succession of
drops that is almost a continuous stream.
Down it falls, this all but stream, a sheer
forty or fifty feet on to the stones of the
basement steps, thence to dribble ignominiously
away into some appointed drain. The
cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
but my lesser waterfalls play a subtler, I had
almost said a more “modern” music. Lying
awake at nights, I listen with a mixture of
pleasure and irritation to its curious cadences.</p>

<p class='c013'>The musical range of a dripping tap is
about half an octave. But within the bounds
of this major fourth, drops can play the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>surprising and varied melodies. You will
hear them climbing laboriously up small degrees
of sound, only to descend at a single
leap to the bottom. More often they wander
unaccountably about in varying intervals,
familiar or disconcertingly odd. And with
the varying pitch the time also varies, but
within narrower limits. For the laws of
hydrostatics, or whatever other science
claims authority over drops, do not allow
the dribblings much licence either to pause
or to quicken the pace of their falling. It
is an odd sort of music. One listens to it
as one lies in bed, slipping gradually into
sleep, with a curious, uneasy emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drip drop, drip drap drep drop. So it
goes on, this watery melody, for ever without
an end. Inconclusive, inconsequent, formless,
it is always on the point of deviating
into sense and form. Every now and then
you will hear a complete phrase of rounded
melody. And then—drip drop, di-drep, di-drap—the
old inconsequence sets in once
more. But suppose there were some significance
in it! It is that which troubles my
drowsy mind as I listen at night. Perhaps
for those who have ears to hear, this endless
dribbling is as pregnant with thought and
emotion, as significant as a piece of Bach.
Drip drop, di-drap, di-drep. So little would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>suffice to turn the incoherence into meaning.
The music of the drops is the symbol and
type of the whole universe; it is for ever, as it
were, asymptotic to sense, infinitely close to
significance, but never touching it. Never,
unless the human mind comes and pulls it
forcibly over the dividing space. If I could
understand this wandering music, if I could
detect in it a sequence, if I could force it to
some conclusion—the diapason closing full
in God, in mind, I hardly care what, so long
as it closes in something definite—then, I
feel, I should understand the whole incomprehensible
machine, from the gaps between
the stars to the policy of the Allies. And
growing drowsier and drowsier, I listen to
the ceaseless tune, the hollow soliloquy in
the cistern, the sharp metallic rapping of the
drops that fall from the roof upon the stones
below; and surely I begin to discover a meaning,
surely I detect a trace of thought, surely
the phrases follow one another with art, leading
on inevitably to some prodigious conclusion.
Almost I have it, almost, almost.... Then,
I suppose, I fall definitely to sleep.
For the next thing I am aware of is that the
sunlight is streaming in. It is morning, and
the water is still dripping as irritatingly and
persistently as ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes the incoherence of the drop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>music is too much to be borne. The listener
insists that the asymptote shall somehow
touch the line of sense. He forces the drops
to say something. He demands of them that
they shall play, shall we say, “God Save the
King,” or the Hymn to Joy from the Ninth
Symphony, or <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Voi che Sapete</span></i>. The drops
obey reluctantly; they play what you desire,
but with more than the ineptitude of the
child at the piano. Still they play it somehow.
But this is an extremely dangerous
method of laying the haunting ghost whose
voice is the drip of water. For once you
have given the drops something to sing or
say, they will go on singing and saying it
for ever. Sleep becomes impossible, and at
the two or three hundredth repetition of
<i>Madelon</i> or even of an air from <i>Figaro</i> the
mind begins to totter towards insanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drops, ticking clocks, machinery, everything
that throbs or clicks or hums or hammers,
can be made, with a little perseverance,
to say something. In my childhood, I remember,
I was told that trains said, “To Lancashire,
to Lancashire, to fetch a pocket
handkercher”—and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">da capo</span></i> ad infinitum.
They can also repeat, if desired, that useful
piece of information: “To stop the train, pull
down the chain.” But it is very hard to
persuade them to add the menacing corollary:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Penalty for improper use Five Pounds.”
Still, with careful tutoring I have succeeded
in teaching a train to repeat even that unrhythmical
phrase.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dadaist literature always reminds me a
little of my falling drops. Confronted by
it, I feel the same uncomfortable emotion as
is begotten in me by the inconsequent music
of water. Suppose, after all, that this apparently
accidental sequence of words should
contain the secret of art and life and the universe!
It may; who knows? And here am
I, left out in the cold of total incomprehension;
and I pore over this literature and regard
it upside down in the hope of discovering
that secret. But somehow I cannot induce
the words to take on any meaning whatever.
Drip drop, di-drap, di-drep—Tzara
and Picabia let fall their words and I am
baffled. But I can see that there are great
possibilities in this type of literature. For
the tired journalist it is ideal, since it is not
he, but the reader who has to do all the work.
All he need do is to lean back in his chair
and allow the words to dribble out through
the nozzle of his fountain pen. Drip,
drop....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>: PLEASURES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We have heard a great deal, since 1914,
about the things which are a menace
to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism;
then the Germans at large; then the
prolongation of the war; then the shortening
of the same; then, after a time, the Treaty of
Versailles; then French militarism—with, all
the while, a running accompaniment of such
minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....</p>

<p class='c013'>Civilization, however, has resisted the
combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully
well. For still, in 1923, it stands not
so very far from where it stood in that “giant
age before the flood” of nine years since.
Where, in relation to Neanderthal on the
one hand and Athens on the other, where
precisely it stood <i>then</i> is a question which
each may answer according to his taste. The
important fact is that these menaces to our
civilization, such as it is—menaces including
the largest war and the stupidest peace known
to history—have confined themselves in most
places and up till now to mere threats, barking
more furiously than they bite.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>No, the dangers which confront our civilization
are not so much the external dangers—wild
men, wars and the bankruptcy that
wars bring after them. The most alarming
dangers are those which menace it from
within, that threaten the mind rather
than the body and estate of contemporary
man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the various poisons which modern
civilization, by a process of auto-intoxication,
brews quietly up within its own bowels,
few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
none appears more harmless) than that curious
and appalling thing that is technically
known as “pleasure.” “Pleasure” (I place
the word between inverted commas to show
that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized
activities officially known by the same
name) “pleasure”—what nightmare visions
the word evokes! Like every man of sense
and good feeling, I abominate work. But I
would rather put in eight hours a day at a
Government office than be condemned to lead
a life of “pleasure”; I would even, I believe,
prefer to write a million words of journalism
a year.</p>

<p class='c013'>The horrors of modern “pleasure” arise
from the fact that every kind of organized
distraction tends to become progressively
more and more imbecile. There was a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>when people indulged themselves with distractions
requiring the expense of a certain
intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century,
for example, royal personages and their
courtiers took a real delight in listening to
erudite sermons (Dr. Donne’s, for example)
and academical disputes on points of theology
or metaphysics. Part of the entertainment
offered to the Prince Palatine, on the
occasion of his marriage with James 1.’s
daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on
I forget what philosophical theme, between
the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a
troop of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine
the feelings of a contemporary prince,
if a loyal University were to offer him a
similar entertainment!</p>

<p class='c013'>Royal personages were not the only people
who enjoyed intelligent pleasures. In Elizabethan
times every lady and gentleman of
ordinary culture could be relied upon, at demand,
to take his or her part in a madrigal
or a motet. Those who know the enormous
complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century
music will realize what this means. To indulge
in their favourite pastime our ancestors
had to exert their minds to an uncommon
degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted
in pleasures requiring the exercise of
a certain intelligence, individuality and personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>initiative. They listened, for example,
to <i>Othello</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i>—apparently
with enjoyment and comprehension.
They sang and made much music. And far
away, in the remote country, the peasants,
year by year, went through the traditional
rites—the dances of spring and summer, the
winter mummings, the ceremonies of harvest
home—appropriate to each successive season.
Their pleasures were intelligent and alive,
and it was they who, by their own efforts,
entertained themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have changed all that. In place of
the old pleasures demanding intelligence and
personal initiative, we have vast organizations
that provide us with ready-made distractions—distractions
which demand from
pleasure-seekers no personal participation
and no intellectual effort of any sort. To
the interminable democracies of the world a
million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash.
There have always been fourth-rate
writers and dramatists; but their works, in
the past, quickly died without getting beyond
the boundaries of the city or the country in
which they appeared. To-day, the inventions
of the scenario-writer go out from Los
Angeles across the whole world. Countless
audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>them, no participation; they need only sit
and keep their eyes open.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do the democracies want music? In the
old days they would have made it themselves.
Now, they merely turn on the gramophone.
Or if they are a little more up-to-date they
adjust their wireless telephone to the right
wave-length and listen-in to the fruity contralto
at Marconi House, singing “The
Gleaner’s Slumber Song.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And if they want literature, there is the
Press. Nominally, it is true, the Press exists
to impart information. But its real function
is to provide, like the cinema, a distraction
which shall occupy the mind without demanding
of it the slightest effort or the fatigue
of a single thought. This function, it
must be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary
success. It is possible to go on
for years and years, reading two papers every
working day and one on Sundays without
ever once being called upon to think or to
make any other effort than to move the eyes,
not very attentively, down the printed
column.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certain sections of the community still
practise athletic sports in which individual
participation is demanded. Great numbers
of the middle and upper classes play golf
and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>rich, shoot birds and pursue the fox
and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass
of the community has now come even to
sport vicariously, preferring the watching of
football to the fatigues and dangers of the
actual game. All classes, it is true, still
dance; but dance, all the world over, the
same steps to the same tunes. The dance has
been scrupulously sterilized of any local or
personal individuality.</p>

<p class='c013'>These effortless pleasures, these ready-made
distractions that are the same for every
one over the face of the whole Western world,
are surely a worse menace to our civilization
than ever the Germans were. The working
hours of the day are already, for the great
majority of human beings, occupied in the
performance of purely mechanical tasks in
which no mental effort, no individuality, no
initiative are required. And now, in the
hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as
mechanically stereotyped and demanding as
little intelligence and initiative as does our
work. Add such leisure to such work and
the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed
relief to come to the end of.</p>

<p class='c013'>Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization
looks as though it might easily decline into
a kind of premature senility. With a mind
almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested
in the ready-made distractions offered
from without that nothing but the
grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence
and crudity can move it, the democracy
of the future will sicken of a chronic
and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps,
the way the Romans went: the Romans who
came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing
now, the capacity to distract themselves;
the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
entertainments in which they had no
participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking
elephants, more rare and far-fetched
animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand
no less; but owing to the existence of
a few idealists, doesn’t get all it asks for.
The most violent forms of entertainment can
only be obtained illicitly; to satisfy a taste
for slaughter and cruelty you must become
a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Let us not
despair, however; we may still live to see
blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome.
The force of a boredom clamouring
to be alleviated may yet prove too much
for the idealists.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>: MODERN FOLK POETRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To all those who are interested in the
“folk” and their poetry—the contemporary
folk of the great cities and their urban
muse—I would recommend a little-known
journal called <i>McGlennon’s Pantomime
Annual</i>. This periodical makes its
appearance at some time in the New Year,
when the pantos are slowly withering away
under the influence of approaching spring.
I take this opportunity of warning my readers
to keep a sharp look out for the coming
of the next issue; it is sure to be worth the
modest twopence which one is asked to pay
for it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>McGlennon’s Pantomime Annual</i> is an
anthology of the lyrics of the panto season’s
most popular songs. It is a document of
first-class importance. To the future student
of our popular literature <i>McGlennon</i> will be
as precious as the Christie-Miller collection
of Elizabethan broadsheets. In the year
2220 a copy of the <i>Pantomime Annual</i> may
very likely sell for hundreds of pounds at
the Sotheby’s of the time. With laudable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>forethought I am preserving my copy of last
year’s <i>McGlennon</i> for the enrichment of my
distant posterity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Folk Poetry of 1920 may best be
classified according to subject-matter. First,
by reason of its tender associations as well
as its mere amount, is the poetry of Passion.
Then there is the Poetry of Filial Devotion.
Next, the Poetry of the Home—the
dear old earthly Home in Oregon or Kentucky—and,
complementary to it, the Poetry
of the Spiritual Home in other and happier
worlds. Here, as well as in the next section,
the popular lyric borrows some of its best
effects from hymnology. There follows the
Poetry of Recollection and Regret, and the
Poetry of Nationality, a type devoted almost
exclusively to the praises of Ireland.
These types and their variations cover the
Folk’s serious poetry. Their comic vein is
less susceptible to analysis. Drink, Wives,
Young Nuts, Honeymoon Couples—these
are a few of the stock subjects.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Amorous Poetry of the Folk, like
the love lyrics of more cultured poets, is
divided into two species: the Poetry of Spiritual
Amour and the more direct and concrete
expression of Immediate Desire. <i>McGlennon</i>
provides plenty of examples of both
types:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>When love peeps in the window of your heart</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>[it might be the first line of a Shakespeare
sonnet]</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You seem to walk on air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Birds sing their sweet songs to you,</div>
      <div class='line'>No cloud in your skies of blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sunshine all the happy day, etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These rhapsodies tend to become a little
tedious. But one feels the warm touch of
reality in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I want to snuggle, I want to snuggle,</div>
      <div class='line'>I know a cosy place for two.</div>
      <div class='line'>I want to snuggle, I want to snuggle,</div>
      <div class='line'>I want to feel that love is true.</div>
      <div class='line'>Take me in your arms as lovers do.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold me very tight and kiss me too.</div>
      <div class='line'>I want to snuggle, I want to snuggle,</div>
      <div class='line'>I want to snuggle close to you.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is sound; but it does not come up to
the best of the popular lyrics. The agonized
passion expressed in the words and music of
“You Made Me Love You” is something one
does not easily forget, though that great song
is as old as the now distant origins of ragtime.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Poetry of Filial Devotion is almost
as extensive as the Poetry of Amour. <i>McGlennon</i>
teems with such outbursts as this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>You are a wonderful mother, dear old mother of mine.</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll hold a spot down deep in my heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the stars no longer shine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Your soul shall live on for ever,</div>
      <div class='line'>On through the fields of time,</div>
      <div class='line'>For there’ll never be another to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Like that wonderful mother of mine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Even Grandmamma gets a share of this devotion:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Granny, my own, I seem to hear you calling me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Granny, my own, you are my sweetest memory ...</div>
      <div class='line'>If up in heaven angels reign supreme,</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the angels you must be the Queen.</div>
      <div class='line'>Granny, my own, I miss you more and more.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The last lines are particularly rich. What
a fascinating heresy, to hold that the angels
reign over their Creator!</p>

<p class='c013'>The Poetry of Recollection and Regret
owes most, both in words and music, to the
hymn. <i>McGlennon</i> provides a choice example
in “Back from the Land of Yesterday”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Back from the land of yesterday,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Back to the friends of yore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Back through the dark and dreary way</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Into the light once more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Back to the heart that waits for me,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Warmed by the sunshine above;</div>
      <div class='line'>Back from the old land of yesterday’s dreams</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To a new land of life and love.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>What it means, goodness only knows. But
one can imagine that, sunk to a slow music in
three-four time—some rich religious waltz-tune—it
would be extremely uplifting and
edifying. The decay of regular churchgoing
has inevitably led to this invasion of the
music-hall by the hymn. People still want
to feel the good uplifting emotion, and they
feel it with a vengeance when they listen to
songs about</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>the land of beginning again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where skies are always blue ...</div>
      <div class='line'>Where broken dreams come true.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The great advantage of the music-hall over
the church is that the uplifting moments do
not last too long.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, there is the great Home motif.
“I want to be,” these lyrics always begin, “I
want to be almost anywhere that is not the
place where I happen at the moment to be.”
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Louis Estève</span> has called this longing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le
Mal de la Province,”</span> which in its turn is
closely related to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le Mal de l’au-delà.”</span> It
is one of the worst symptoms of romanticism.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Steamer, balançant ta mâture,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lève l’ancre vers une exotique nature,</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>exclaims <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mallarmé</span>, and the Folk, whom that
most exquisite of poets loathed and despised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>echo his words in a hundred different keys.
There is not a State in America where they
don’t want to go. In <i>McGlennon</i> we find
yearnings expressed for California, Ohio,
Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia. Some
sigh for Ireland, Devon, and the East.
“Egypt! I am calling you; oh, life is sweet
and joys complete when at your feet I lay
[<i>sic</i>].” But the Southern States, the East,
Devon, and Killarney are not enough. The
Mal de l’au-delà succeeds the Mal de la
Province. The Folk yearn for extra-mundane
worlds. Here, for example, is an expression
of nostalgia for a mystical “Kingdom
within your Eyes”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Somewhere in somebody’s eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is a place just divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bounded by roses that kiss the dew</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In those dear eyes that shine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Somewhere beyond earthly dreams,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where love’s flower never dies,</div>
      <div class='line'>God made the world, and He gave it to me</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In that kingdom within your eyes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>If there is any characteristic which distinguishes
contemporary folk poetry from the
folk poetry of other times it is surely its
meaninglessness. Old folk poetry is singularly
direct and to the point, full of pregnant
meaning, never vague. Modern folk
poetry, as exemplified in <i>McGlennon</i>, is almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>perfectly senseless. The Elizabethan
peasant or mechanic would never have consented
to sing or listen to anything so flatulently
meaningless as “Back from the Land
of Yesterday” or “The Kingdom within your
Eyes.” His taste was for something clear,
definite and pregnant, like “Greensleeves”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And every morning when you rose,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I brought you dainties orderly,</div>
      <div class='line'>To clear your stomach from all woes—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And yet you would not love me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Could anything be more logical and to the
point? But we, instead of logic, instead of
clarity, are provided by our professional entertainers
with the drivelling imbecility of
“Granny, my own.” Can it be that the standard
of intelligence is lower now than it was
three hundred years ago? Have newspapers
and cinemas and now the wireless telephone
conspired to rob mankind of whatever sense
of reality, whatever power of individual
questioning and criticism he once possessed?
I do not venture to answer. But the fact
of <i>McGlennon</i> has somehow got to be explained.
How? I prefer to leave the problem
on a note of interrogation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='8'>VIII</abbr>: BIBLIOPHILY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bibliophily is on the increase. It is
a constatation which I make with regret;
for the bibliophile’s point of view is, to me
at least, unsympathetic and his standard of
values unsound. Among the French, bibliophily
would seem to have become a kind
of mania, and, what is more, a highly organized
and thoroughly exploited mania.
Whenever I get a new French book I turn at
once—for in what disgusts and irritates one
there is always a certain odious fascination—to
the fly-leaf. One had always been accustomed
to finding there a brief description
of the “vingt exemplaires sur papier hollande
Van Gelder”; nobody objected to the
modest old Dutchman whose paper gave to
the author’s presentation copies so handsome
an appearance. But Van Gelder is now a
back number. In this third decade of the
twentieth century he has become altogether
too simple and unsophisticated. On the fly-leaf
of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernière nouveauté</span></i> I find the following
incantation, printed in block capitals
and occupying at least twenty lines:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span></div>
<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a été tiré de cet ouvrage, après impositions

</div>

<p class='c013'>If I were one of the hundred Bibliophiles
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelle Revue Française</span></i> or even one
of the eight hundred Friends of the Original
Edition, I should suggest, with the utmost
politeness, that the publishers might deserve
better of their fellow-beings if they spent
less pains on numbering the first edition and
more on seeing that it was properly produced.
Personally, I am the friend of any edition
which is reasonably well printed and bound,
reasonably correct in the text and reasonably
clean. The consciousness that I possess a
numbered copy of an edition printed on
Lafuma-Navarre paper, duly watermarked
with the publisher’s initials, does not make
up for the fact that the book is full of gross
printer’s errors and that a whole sheet of sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>pages has wandered, during the process
of binding, from one end of the volume to
the other—occurrences which are quite unnecessarily
frequent in the history of French
book production.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the increased attention paid to
bibliophilous niceties, has come a great increase
in price. Limited <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditions de luxe</span></i> have
become absurdly common in France, and
there are dozens of small publishing concerns
which produce almost nothing else. Authors
like Monsieur André Salmon and Monsieur
Max Jacob scarcely ever appear at less than
twenty francs a volume. Even with the exchange
this is a formidable price; and yet the
French bibliophiles, for whom twenty francs
are really twenty francs, appear to have an
insatiable appetite for these small and beautiful
editions. The War has established a
new economic law: the poorer one becomes
the more one can afford to spend on luxuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ordinary English publisher has never
gone in for Van Gelder, Lafuma-Navarre
and numbered editions. Reticent about figures,
he leaves the book collector to estimate
the first edition’s future rarity by guesswork.
He creates no artificial scarcity values.
The collector of contemporary English
first editions is wholly a speculator; he never
knows what time may have in store.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>In the picture trade for years past nobody
has pretended that there was any particular
relation between the price of a picture and
its value as a work of art. A magnificent
El Greco is bought for about a tenth of the
sum paid for a Romney that would be condemned
by any self-respecting hanging-committee.
We are so well used to this sort of
thing in picture dealing that we have almost
ceased to comment on it. But in the book
trade the tendency to create huge artificial
values is of a later growth. The spectacle
of a single book being bought for fifteen
thousand pounds is still sufficiently novel to
arouse indignation. Moreover, the book collector
who pays vast sums for his treasures
has even less excuse than has the collector
of pictures. The value of an old book is
wholly a scarcity value. From a picture one
may get a genuine æsthetic pleasure; in buying
a picture one buys the unique right to
feel that pleasure. But nobody can pretend
that <i>Venus and Adonis</i> is more delightful
when it is read in a fifteen thousand pound
unique copy than when it is read in a volume
that has cost a shilling. On the whole, the
printing and general appearance of the
shilling book is likely to be the better of the
two. The purchaser of the fabulously expensive
old book is satisfying only his possessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>instinct. The buyer of a picture may
also have a genuine feeling for beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>The triumph and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i>
of bibliophily were witnessed not long ago
at Sotheby’s, when the late Mr. Smith of
New York bought eighty thousand pounds’
worth of books in something under two hours
at the Britwell Court sale. The War, it is said,
created forty thousand new millionaires in
America; the New York bookseller can have
had no lack of potential clients. He bought
a thousand guinea volume as an ordinary human
being might buy something off the sixpenny
shelf in a second-hand shop. I have
seldom witnessed a spectacle which inspired
in me an intenser blast of moral indignation.
Moral indignation, of course, is always to be
mistrusted as, wholly or in part, the disguised
manifestation of some ignoble passion. In
this case the basic cause of my indignation
was clearly envy. But there was, I flatter
myself, a superstructure of disinterested
moral feeling. To debase a book into an
expensive object of luxury is as surely, in
Miltonic language, “to kill the image of God,
as it were in the eye” as to burn it. And
when one thinks how those eighty thousand
pounds might have been spent.... Ah,
well!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='9'>IX</abbr>: DEMOCRATIC ART</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is intoxication to be found in a
crowd. For it is good to be one of
many all doing the same thing—good whatever
the thing may be, whether singing
hymns, watching a football match, or applauding
the eternal truths of politicians.
Anything will serve as an excuse. It matters
not in whose name your two or three
thousand are gathered together; what is important
is the process of gathering. In these
last days we have witnessed a most illuminating
example of this tendency in the wild
outburst of mob excitement over the arrival
in this country of Mary Pickford. It is not
as though people were really very much interested
in the Little Sweetheart of the
World. She is no more than an excuse for
assembling in a crowd and working up a
powerful communal emotion. The newspapers
set the excitement going; they built the
fire, applied the match, and cherished the infant
flame. The crowds, only too happy to
be kindled, did the rest; they burned.</p>

<p class='c013'>I belong to that class of unhappy people
who are not easily infected by crowd excitement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Too often I find myself sadly and
coldly unmoved in the midst of multitudinous
emotion. Few sensations are more
disagreeable. The defect is in part temperamental,
and in part is due to that intellectual
snobbishness, that fastidious rejection of
what is easy and obvious, which is one of the
melancholy consequences of the acquisition
of culture. How often one regrets this asceticism
of the mind! How wistfully sometimes
one longs to be able to rid oneself of
the habit of rejection and selection, and to
enjoy all the dear, obviously luscious, idiotic
emotions without an afterthought! And
indeed, however much we may admire the
Chromatic Fantasia of Bach, we all of us
have a soft spot somewhere in our minds
that is sensitive to “Roses in Picardy.” But
the soft spot is surrounded by hard spots;
the enjoyment is never unmixed with critical
disapprobation. The excuses for working
up a communal emotion, even communal
emotion itself, are rejected as too gross. We
turn from them as a cœnobite of the Thebaid
would have turned from dancing girls or a
steaming dish of tripe and onions.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have before me now a little book, recently
arrived from America, which points
out the way in which the random mob emotion
may be systematically organized into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>kind of religion. This volume, <i>The Will of
Song</i> (Boni &amp; Liveright, 70 c.), is the joint
production of Messrs. Harry Barnhart and
Percy MacKaye. “How are art and social
service to be reconciled?... How shall
the Hermit Soul of the Individual Poet give
valid, spontaneous expression to the Communal
Soul of assembled multitudes? How
may the surging Tides of Man be sluiced in
Conduits of Art, without losing their primal
glory and momentum?” These questions
and many others, involving a great expense
of capital letters, are asked by Mr. MacKaye
and answered in <i>The Will of Song</i>, which
bears the qualifying sub-title, “A Dramatic
Service of Community Singing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The service is democratically undogmatic.
Abstractions, such as Will, Imagination,
Joy, Love and Liberty, some of whom are
represented in the dramatic performance,
not by individuals, but by Group Personages
(<i>i.e.</i>, choruses), chant about Brotherhood in
a semi-Biblical phraseology that is almost
wholly empty of content. It is all delightfully
vague and non-committal, like a Cabinet
Minister’s speech about the League of
Nations, and, like such a speech, leaves behind
it a comfortable glow, a noble feeling
of uplift. But, like Cabinet Ministers,
preachers and all whose profession it is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>move the people by the emission of words,
the authors of <i>The Will of Song</i> are well
aware that what matters in a popular work
of art is not the intellectual content so much
as the picturesqueness of its form and the
emotion with which it is presented. In the
staging—if such a term is not irreverent—of
their service, Messrs. Barnhart and MacKaye
have borrowed from Roman Catholic
ritual all its most effective emotion-creators.
The darknesses, the illuminations, the chiming
bells, the solemn mysterious voices, the
choral responses—all these traditional devices
have been most scientifically exploited
in the Communal Service.</p>

<p class='c013'>These are the stage directions which herald
the opening of the service:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>As the final song of the Prelude ceases, the assembly
hall grows suddenly dark, and the <span class='sc'>Darkness</span>
is filled with fanfare of blowing <span class='sc'>Trumpets</span>.
And now, taking up the trumpets’ refrain, the Orchestra
plays an elemental music, suggestive of rain,
wind, thunder and the rushing of waters; from behind
the raised Central Seat great Flashes of Fire
spout upward, and while they are flaring there
rises a <span class='sc'>Flame Gold Figure</span>, in a cone of light,
who calls with deep, vibrant voice: “Who has risen
up from the heart of the people?” Instantaneous,
from three portions of the assembly, the <span class='sc'>Voices of
Three Groups</span>, Men, Women and Children, answer
from the dark in triple unison: “I!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Even from the cold print one can see that
this opening would be extremely effective.
But doubts assail me. I have a horrid suspicion
that that elemental music would not
sweep me off my feet as it ought to. My
fears are justified when, looking up the musical
programme, I discover that the elemental
music is by Langey, and that the orchestral
accompaniments that follow are the work
of Massenet, Tschaikovsky, Langey once
more, Julia Ward Howe and Sinding. Alas!
once more one finds oneself the slave of one’s
habit of selection and rejection. One would
find oneself left out in the cold just because
one couldn’t stand Massenet. Those who
have seen Sir James Barrie’s latest play,
<i>Mary Rose</i>, will perhaps recall the blasts of
music which prelude the piece and recur at
every mystical moment throughout the play.
In theory one ought to have mounted on the
wings of that music into a serene acceptance
of Sir James Barrie’s supernatural machinery;
one ought to have been filled by it with
deeply religious emotions. In practice, however,
one found oneself shrinking with quivering
nerves from the poignant vulgarity of
that <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Leitmotif</span></i>, isolated by what should have
united one with the author and the rest of
the audience. The cœnobite would like to
eat the tripe and onions, but finds by experiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>that the smell of the dish makes him
feel rather sick.</p>

<p class='c013'>One must not, however, reject such things
as <i>The Will of Song</i> as absolutely and entirely
bad. They are useful, they are even
good, on their own plane and for people
who belong to a certain order of the spiritual
hierarchy. <i>The Will of Song</i>, set to elemental
music by Massenet and Julia Ward
Howe, may be a moving spiritual force for
people to whom, shall we say, Wagner means
nothing; just as Wagner himself may be of
spiritual importance to people belonging to
a slightly higher caste, but still incapable of
understanding or getting any good out of
the highest, the transcendent works of art—out
of the Mass in D, for example, or Sonata
Op. 111.</p>

<p class='c013'>The democratically minded will ask what
right we have to say that the Mass in D is
better than the works of Julia Ward Howe,
what right we have to assign a lower place
in the spiritual hierarchy to the admirers of
<i>The Will of Song</i> than to the admirers of
Beethoven. They will insist that there is
no hierarchy at all; that every creature possessing
humanity, possessing even life, is as
good and as important, by the mere fact of
that possession, as any other creature. It is
not altogether easy to answer these objections.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The arguments on both sides are ultimately
based on conviction and faith. The
best one can do to convince the paradoxical
democrat of the real superiority of the Mass
in D over <i>The Will of Song</i> is to point out
that, in a sense, one contains the other; that
<i>The Will of Song</i> is a part, and a very small
part at that, of a great Whole of human experience,
to which the Mass in D much more
nearly approximates. In <i>The Will of Song</i>,
and its “elemental” accompaniment one
knows exactly how every effect is obtained;
its range of emotional and intellectual experience
is extremely limited and perfectly familiar.
But the range of the Mass in D is
enormously much larger; it includes within
itself the range of <i>The Will of Song</i>, takes
it for granted, so to speak, and reaches out
into remoter spheres of experience. It is in
a real sense quantitatively larger than <i>The
Will of Song</i>. To the democrat who believes
in majorities this is an argument which must
surely prove convincing.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='10'>X</abbr>: ACCUMULATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the brevity of life and the perishableness
of material things the moral philosophers
have always found one of their happiest
themes. “Time, which antiquates Antiquities,
hath an Art to make dust of all things.”
There is nothing more moving than those
swelling elegiac organ notes in which they
have celebrated the mortality of man and all
his works. Those of us for whom the proper
study of mankind is books dwell with the
most poignant melancholy over the destruction
of literary treasures. We think of all
the pre-Platonic philosophers of whose writings
only a few sentences remain. We think
of Sappho’s poems, all but completely blotted
from our knowledge. We think of the
missing fragments of the “Satyricon,” and
of many other precious pages which once
were and are now no more. We complain
of the holes that time has picked in the records
of history, bewailing the loss of innumerable
vanished documents. As for buildings,
pictures, statues and the accumulated
evidence of whole civilizations, all destroyed
as though they had never been, they do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>belong to our literary province, and, if they
did, would be too numerous to catalogue
even summarily.</p>

<p class='c013'>But because men have once thought and
felt in a certain way it does not follow that
they will for ever continue to do so. There
seems every probability that our descendants,
some two or three centuries hence, will wax
pathetic in their complaints, not of the fragility,
but the horrible persistence and indestructibility
of things. They will feel themselves
smothered by the intolerable accumulation
of the years. The men of to-day are
so deeply penetrated with the sense of the
perishableness of matter that they have begun
to take immense precautions to preserve
everything they can. Desolated by the carelessness
of our ancestors, we are making very
sure that our descendants shall lack no documents
when they come to write our history.
All is systematically kept and catalogued.
Old things are carefully patched and propped
into continued existence; things now new
are hoarded up and protected from decay.</p>

<p class='c013'>To walk through the book-stores of one of
the world’s great libraries is an experience
that cannot fail to set one thinking on the
appalling indestructibility of matter. A few
years ago I explored the recently dug cellars
into which the overflow of the Bodleian pours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>in an unceasing stream. The cellars extend
under the northern half of the great quadrangle
in whose centre stands the Radcliffe
Camera. These catacombs are two storeys
deep and lined with impermeable concrete.
“The muddy damps and ropy slime” of the
traditional vault are absent in this great
necropolis of letters; huge ventilating pipes
breathe blasts of a dry and heated wind, that
makes the place as snug and as unsympathetic
to decay as the deserts of Central Asia. The
books stand in metal cases constructed so as
to slide in and out of position on rails. So
ingenious is the arrangement of the cases that
it is possible to fill two-thirds of the available
space, solidly, with books. Twenty
years or so hence, when the existing vaults
will take no more books, a new cellar can
be dug on the opposite side of the Camera.
And when that is full—it is only a matter of
half a century from now—what then? We
shrug our shoulders. After us the deluge.
But let us hope that Bodley’s Librarian of
1970 will have the courage to emend the last
word to “bonfire.” To the bonfire! That
is the only satisfactory solution of an intolerable
problem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The deliberate preservation of things must
be compensated for by their deliberate and
judicious destruction. Otherwise the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>will be overwhelmed by the accumulation of
antique objects. Pigs and rabbits and watercress,
when they were first introduced into
New Zealand, threatened to lay waste the
country, because there were no compensating
forces of destruction to put a stop to their
indefinite multiplication. In the same way,
mere things, once they are set above the natural
laws of decay, will end by burying us,
unless we set about methodically to get rid
of the nuisance. The plea that they should
all be preserved—every novel by Nat Gould,
every issue of the <i>Funny Wonder</i>—as historical
documents is not a sound one. Where
too many documents exist it is impossible to
write history at all. “For ignorance,” in the
felicitous words of Mr. Lytton Strachey, “is
the first requisite of the historian—ignorance
which simplifies and clarifies, which selects
and omits, with a placid perfection unattainable
by the highest art.” Nobody wants
to know everything—the irrelevancies as
well as the important facts—about the past;
or in any case nobody ought to desire to
know. Those who do, those who are eaten
up by an itch for mere facts and useless information,
are the wretched victims of a vice
no less reprehensible than greed or drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hand in hand with this judicious process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of destruction must go an elaborate classification
of what remains. As Mr. Wells says
in his large, opulent way, “the future world-state’s
organization of scientific research and
record compared with that of to-day will be
like an ocean liner beside the dug-out canoe
of some early heliolithic wanderer.” With
the vast and indiscriminate multiplication of
books and periodicals our organization of
records tends to become ever more heliolithic.
Useful information on any given subject
is so widely scattered or may be hidden
in such obscure places that the student is
often at a loss to know what he ought to
study or where. An immense international
labour of bibliography and classification
must be undertaken at no very distant date,
if future generations of researchers are to
make the fullest use of the knowledge that
has already been gained.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this constructive labour will be tedious
and insipid compared with the glorious business
of destruction. Huge bonfires of paper
will blaze for days and weeks together, whenever
the libraries undertake their periodical
purgation. The only danger, and, alas! it is
a very real danger, is that the libraries will
infallibly purge themselves of the wrong
books. We all know what librarians are;
and not only librarians, but critics, literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>men, general public—everybody, in fact,
with the exception of ourselves—we know
what they are like, we know them: there
never was a set of people with such bad
taste! Committees will doubtless be set up
to pass judgment on books, awarding acquittals
and condemnations in magisterial fashion.
It will be a sort of gigantic Hawthornden
competition. At that thought I
find that the flames of my great bonfires lose
much of their imagined lustre.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='11'>XI</abbr>: ON DEVIATING INTO SENSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is a story, very dear for some
reason to our ancestors, that Apelles,
or I forget what other Greek painter, grown
desperate at the failure of his efforts to portray
realistically the foam on a dog’s mouth,
threw his sponge at the picture in a pet, and
was rewarded for his ill-temper by discovering
that the resultant smudge was the living
image of the froth whose aspect he had been
unable, with all his art, to recapture. No
one will ever know the history of all the
happy mistakes, the accidents and unconscious
deviations into genius, that have
helped to enrich the world’s art. They are
probably countless. I myself have deviated
more than once into accidental felicities.
Recently, for example, the hazards of careless
typewriting caused me to invent a new
portmanteau word of the most brilliantly
Laforguian quality. I had meant to write
the phrase “the Human Comedy,” but, by a
happy slip, I put my finger on the letter
that stands next to “C” on the universal keyboard.
When I came to read over the completed
page I found that I had written “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Human Vomedy.” Was there ever a criticism
of life more succinct and expressive?
To the more sensitive and queasy among the
gods the last few years must indeed have
seemed a vomedy of the first order.</p>

<p class='c013'>The grossest forms of mistake have
played quite a distinguished part in the history
of letters. One thinks, for example, of
the name Criseida or Cressida manufactured
out of a Greek accusative, of that Spenserian
misunderstanding of Chaucer which gave
currency to the rather ridiculous substantive
“derring-do.” Less familiar, but more deliciously
absurd, is Chaucer’s slip in reading
“naves ballatrices” for “naves bellatrices”—ballet-ships
instead of battle-ships—and his
translation “shippes hoppesteres.” But these
broad, straightforward howlers are uninteresting
compared with the more subtle deviations
into originality occasionally achieved
by authors who were trying their best not to
be original. Nowhere do we find more remarkable
examples of accidental brilliance
than among the post-Chaucerian poets, whose
very indistinct knowledge of what precisely
<i>was</i> the metre in which they were trying to
write often caused them to produce very
striking variations on the staple English
measure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Chaucer’s variations from the decasyllable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>norm were deliberate. So, for the most
part, were those of his disciple Lydgate,
whose favourite “broken-backed” line, lacking
the first syllable of the iambus that follows
the cæsura, is metrically of the greatest
interest to contemporary poets. Lydgate’s
characteristic line follows this model:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For speechéless nothing maist thou speed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Judiciously employed, the broken-backed
line might yield very beautiful effects. Lydgate,
as has been said, was probably pretty
conscious of what he was doing. But his
procrustean methods were apt to be a little
indiscriminate, and one wonders sometimes
whether he was playing variations on a
known theme or whether he was rather tentatively
groping after the beautiful regularity
of his master Chaucer. The later fifteenth
and sixteenth century poets seem to
have worked very much in the dark. The
poems of such writers as Hawes and Skelton
abound in the vaguest parodies of the decasyllable
line. Anything from seven to fifteen
syllables will serve their turn. With
them the variations are seldom interesting.
Chance had not much opportunity of producing
subtle metrical effects with a man like
Skelton, whose mind was naturally so full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of jigging doggerel that his variations on
the decasyllable are mostly in the nature of
rough skeltonics. I have found interesting
accidental variations on the decasyllable in
Heywood, the writer of moralities. This,
from the <i>Play of Love</i>, has a real metrical
beauty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Felt ye but one pang such as I feel many,</div>
      <div class='line'>One pang of despair or one pang of desire,</div>
      <div class='line'>One pang of one displeasant look of her eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>One pang of one word of her mouth as in ire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or in restraint of her love which I desire—</div>
      <div class='line'>One pang of all these, felt once in all your life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should quail your opinion and quench all our strife.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These dactylic resolutions of the third and
fourth lines are extremely interesting.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the most remarkable example of accidental
metrical invention that I have yet
come across is to be found in the Earl of
Surrey’s translation of Horace’s ode on the
golden mean. Surrey was one of the pioneers
of the reaction against the vagueness and
uncertain carelessness of the post-Chaucerians.
From the example of Italian poetry
he had learned that a line must have a fixed
number of syllables. In all his poems his
aim is always to achieve regularity at whatever
cost. To make sure of having ten syllables
in every line it is evident that Surrey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>made use of his fingers as well as his ears.
We see him at his worst and most laborious
in the first stanza of his translation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of thy life, Thomas, this compass well mark:</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne by coward dread in shunning storms dark</div>
      <div class='line'>Not aye with full sails the high seas to beat;</div>
      <div class='line'>On shallow shores thy keel in peril freat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ten syllables are there all right, but
except in the last line there is no recognizable
rhythm of any kind, whether regular or
irregular. But when Surrey comes to the
second stanza—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Auream quisquis mediocritatem</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sobrius aula—</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>some lucky accident inspires him with the
genius to translate in these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whoso gladly halseth the golden mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>Void of dangers advisedly hath his home;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not with loathsome muck as a den unclean,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor palace like, whereat disdain may gloam.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not only is this a very good translation, but
it is also a very interesting and subtle metrical
experiment. What could be more
felicitous than this stanza made up of three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>trochaic lines, quickened by beautiful dactylic
resolutions, and a final iambic line of
regular measure—the recognized tonic
chord that brings the music to its close?
And yet the tunelessness of the first stanza
is enough to prove that Surrey’s achievement
is as much a product of accident as the foam
on the jaws of Apelles’ dog. He was doing
his best all the time to write decasyllabics
with the normal iambic beat of the last line.
His failures to do so were sometimes unconscious
strokes of genius.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='12'>XII</abbr>: POLITE CONVERSATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are some people to whom the
most difficult to obey of all the commandments
is that which enjoins us to suffer
fools gladly. The prevalence of folly, its
monumental, unchanging permanence and its
almost invariable triumph over intelligence
are phenomena which they cannot contemplate
without experiencing a passion of
righteous indignation or, at the least, of ill-temper.
Sages like Anatole France, who can
probe and anatomize human stupidity and
still remain serenely detached, are rare.
These reflections were suggested by a book
recently published in New York and entitled
<i>The American Credo</i>. The authors of this
work are those <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfants terribles</span></i> of American
criticism, Messrs. H. L. Mencken and
George Jean Nathan. They have compiled
a list of four hundred and eighty-eight articles
of faith which form the fundamental
Credo of the American people, prefacing
them with a very entertaining essay on the
national mind:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Truth shifts and changes like a cataract of diamonds;
its aspect is never precisely the same at two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>successive moments. But error flows down the
channel of history like some great stream of lava
or infinitely lethargic glacier. It is the one relatively
fixed thing in a world of chaos.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>To look through the articles of the Credo is
to realize that there is a good deal of truth
in this statement. Such beliefs as the following—not
by any means confined to
America alone—are probably at least as old
as the Great Pyramid:</p>

<p class='c013'>That if a woman, about to become a
mother, plays the piano every day, her baby
will be born a Victor Herbert.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the accumulation of great wealth always
brings with it great unhappiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>That it is bad luck to kill a spider.</p>

<p class='c013'>That water rots the hair and thus causes
baldness.</p>

<p class='c013'>That if a bride wears an old garter with
her new finery, she will have a happy married
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>That children were much better behaved
twenty years ago than they are to-day.</p>

<p class='c013'>And most of the others in the collection,
albeit clothed in forms distinctively contemporary
and American, are simply variations
on notions as immemorial.</p>

<p class='c013'>Inevitably, as one reads <i>The American
Credo</i>, one is reminded of an abler, a more
pitiless and ferocious onslaught on stupidity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>I mean Swift’s “<i>Complete Collection of Genteel
and Ingenious Conversation, according
to the most polite mode and method now
used at Court and in the Best Companies of
England</i>. In three Dialogues. By Simon
Wagstaff, Esq.” I was inspired after reading
Messrs. Mencken and Nathan’s work to
refresh my memories of this diabolic picture
of the social amenities. And what a book it
is! There is something almost appalling in
the way it goes on and on, a continuous,
never-ceasing stream of imbecility. Simon
Wagstaff, it will be remembered, spent the
best part of forty years in collecting and
digesting these gems of polite conversation:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>I can faithfully assure the reader that there is
not one single witty phrase in the whole Collection
which has not received the Stamp and Approbation
of at least One Hundred Years, and how much
longer it is hard to determine; he may therefore be
secure to find them all genuine, sterling and
authentic.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>How genuine, sterling and authentic Mr.
Wagstaff’s treasures of polite conversation
are is proved by the great number of them
which have withstood all the ravages of
time, and still do as good service to-day as
they did in the early seventeen-hundreds or
in the days of Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>: “Go, you Girl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and warm some fresh Cream.” “Indeed,
Madam, there’s none left; for the Cat has
eaten it all.” “I doubt it was a Cat with
Two Legs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And, pray, What News, Mr. Neverout?”
“Why, Madam, Queen Elizabeth’s
dead.” (It would be interesting to discover
at exactly what date Queen Anne took the
place of Queen Elizabeth in this grand old
repartee, or who was the monarch referred to
when the Virgin Queen was still alive.
Aspirants to the degree of B. or D.Litt.
might do worse than to take this problem as
a subject for their thesis.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the choicest phrases have come
down in the world since Mr. Wagstaff’s day.
Thus, Miss Notable’s retort to Mr. Neverout,
“Go, teach your Grannam to suck
Eggs,” could only be heard now in the
dormitory of a preparatory school. Others
have become slightly modified. Mr. Neverout
says, “Well, all Things have an End,
and a pudden has two.” I think we may
flatter ourselves that the modern emendation,
“except a roly-poly pudding, which has
two,” is an improvement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Wagstaff’s second dialogue, wherein
he treats of Polite Conversation at meals,
contains more phrases that testify to the unbroken
continuity of tradition than either of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the others. The conversation that centres
on the sirloin of beef is worthy to be recorded
in its entirety:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lady Smart.</span> Come, Colonel, handle your Arms.
Shall I help you to some Beef?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Colonel.</span> If your Ladyship please; and, pray,
don’t cut like a Mother-in-law, but send me a large
Slice; for I love to lay a good Foundation. I vow,
’tis a noble Sir-loyn.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Neverout.</span> Ay; here’s cut and come again.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Miss.</span> But, pray; why is it call’d a Sir-loyn?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lord Smart.</span> Why, you must know that our
King James the First, who lov’d good Eating, being
invited to Dinner by one of his Nobles, and
seeing a large Loyn of Beef at his Table, he drew
out his Sword, and, in a Frolic, knighted it. Few
people know the Secret of this.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>How delightful it is to find that we have
Mr. Wagstaff’s warrant for such gems of wisdom
as, “Cheese digests everything except
itself,” and “If you eat till you’re cold,
you’ll live to grow old”! If they were a
hundred years old in his day they are fully
three hundred now. Long may they survive!
I was sorry, however, to notice that
one of the best of Mr. Wagstaff’s phrases has
been, in the revolution of time, completely
lost. Indeed, before I had read Aubrey’s
“Lives,” Lord Sparkish’s remark, “Come, box
it about; ’twill come to my Father at last,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>was quite incomprehensible to me. The
phrase is taken from a story of Sir Walter
Raleigh and his son.</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Sir Walter Raleigh [says Aubrey] being invited
to dinner to some great person where his son was
to goe with him, he sayd to his son, “Thou art expected
to-day at dinner to goe along with me, but
thou art so quarrelsome and affronting that I am
ashamed to have such a beare in my company.”
Mr. Walter humbled himselfe to his father and
promised he would behave himselfe mighty mannerly.
So away they went. He sate next to his
father and was very demure at least halfe dinner
time. Then sayd he, “I this morning, not having
the feare of God before my eies, but by the instigation
of the devill, went....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>At this point Mr. Clark, in his edition, suppresses
four lines of Aubrey’s text; but one
can imagine the sort of thing Master Walter
said.</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Sir Walter, being strangely surprized and putt out
of countenance at so great a table, gives his son a
damned blow over the face. His son, as rude as
he was, would not strike his father, but strikes over
the face the gentleman that sate next to him and
sayd, “Box about: ’twill come to my father anon.”
’Tis now a common-used proverb.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>And so it still deserves to be; how, when and
why it became extinct, I have no idea. Here
is another good subject for a thesis.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>There are but few things in Mr. Wagstaff’s
dialogue which appear definitely out
of date and strange to us, and these super-annuations
can easily be accounted for.
Thus the repeal of the Criminal Laws has
made almost incomprehensible the constant
references to hanging made by Mr. Wagstaff’s
personages. The oaths and the occasional
mild grossnesses have gone out of
fashion in mixed polite society. Otherwise
their conversation is in all essentials exactly
the same as the conversation of the present
day. And this is not to be wondered at; for,
as a wise man has said:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Speech at the present time retains strong evidence
of the survival in it of the function of herd recognition....
The function of conversation is ordinarily
regarded as being the exchange of ideas and
information. Doubtless it has come to have such
a function, but an objective examination of ordinary
conversation shows that the actual conveyance
of ideas takes a very small part in it. As a
rule the exchange seems to consist of ideas which
are necessarily common to the two speakers and
are known to be so by each.... Conversation between
persons unknown to one another is apt to
be rich in the ritual of recognition. When one
hears or takes part in these elaborate evolutions,
gingerly proffering one after another of one’s marks
of identity, one’s views on the weather, on fresh
air and draughts, on the Government and on uric
acid, watching intently for the first low hint of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>growl, which will show one belongs to the wrong
pack and must withdraw, it is impossible not to
be reminded of the similar manœuvres of the dog
and to be thankful that Nature has provided us with
a less direct, though perhaps a more tedious, code.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='13'>XIII</abbr>: NATIONALITY IN LOVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The hazards of indiscriminate rummaging
in bookshops have introduced me
to two volumes of verse which seem to me
(though I am ordinarily very sceptical of
those grandiose generalizations about racial
and national characteristics, so beloved of a
certain class of literary people) to illustrate
very clearly some of the differences between
the French and English mind. The first is
a little book published some few months back
and entitled <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Baisers</span></i>.... The publisher
says of it in one of those exquisitely
literary puffs which are the glory of the
Paris book trade: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Un volume de vers? Non
pas! Simplement des baisers mis en vers,
des baisers variés comme l’heure qui passe,
inconstants comme l’Amour lui-même....
Baisers, baisers, c’est toute leur troublante
musique qui chante dans ces rimes.”</span> The
other volume hails from the antipodes and
is called <i>Songs of Love and Life</i>. No publisher’s
puff accompanies it; but a coloured
picture on the dust-wrapper represents a
nymph frantically clutching at a coy shepherd.
A portrait of the authoress serves as a
frontispiece. Both books are erotic in character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and both are very indifferent in poetical
quality. They are only interesting as
illustrations, the more vivid because of their
very second-rateness, of the two characteristic
methods of approach, French and English,
to the theme of physical passion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The author of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Baisers</span></i> approaches his
amorous experiences with the detached manner
of a psychologist interested in the mental
reactions of certain corporeal pleasures
whose mechanism he has previously studied
in his capacity of physiological observer. His
attitude is the same as that of the writers
of those comedies of manners which hold the
stage in the theatres of the boulevards. It
is dry, precise, matter-of-fact and almost
scientific. The comedian of the boulevards
does not concern himself with trying to find
some sort of metaphysical justification for
the raptures of physical passion, nor is he
in any way a propagandist of sensuality. He
is simply an analyst of facts, whose business
it is to get all the wit that is possible out of
an equivocal situation. Similarly, the author
of these poems is far too highly sophisticated
to imagine that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>every spirit as it is most pure,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hath in it the more of heavenly light,</div>
      <div class='line'>So it the fairer body doth procure</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>To habit in, and it more fairly dight</div>
      <div class='line'>With cheerful grace and amiable sight.</div>
      <div class='line'>For of the soul the body form doth take;</div>
      <div class='line'>For soul is form and doth the body make.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He does not try to make us believe that
physical pleasures have a divine justification.
Neither has he any wish to “make us
grovel, hand and foot in Belial’s gripe.” He
is merely engaged in remembering <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“des heures
et des entretiens”</span> which were extremely
pleasant—hours which strike for every one,
conversations and meetings which are taking
place in all parts of the world and at every
moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>This attitude towards <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volupté</span></i> is sufficiently
old in France to have made possible
the evolution of a very precise and definite
vocabulary in which to describe its phenomena.
This language is as exact as the technical
jargon of a trade, and as elegant as the
Latin of Petronius. It is a language of which
we have no equivalent in our English literature.
It is impossible in English to describe
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volupté</span></i> elegantly; it is hardly possible
to write of it without being gross. To
begin with, we do not even possess a word
equivalent to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volupté</span></i>. “Voluptuousness” is
feeble and almost meaningless; “pleasure”
is hopelessly inadequate. From the first the
English writer is at a loss; he cannot even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>name precisely the thing he proposes to describe
and analyze. But for the most part
he has not much use for such a language.
His approach to the subject is not dispassionate
and scientific, and he has no need for
technicalities. The English amorist is inclined
to approach the subject rapturously,
passionately, philosophically—almost in any
way that is not the wittily matter-of-fact
French way.</p>

<p class='c013'>In our rich Australian <i>Songs of Love and
Life</i> we see the rapturous-philosophic approach
reduced to something that is very
nearly the absurd. Overcome with the intensities
of connubial bliss, the authoress
feels it necessary to find a sort of justification
for them by relating them in some way
with the cosmos. God, we are told,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>looking through His hills on you and me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feeds Heaven upon the flame of our desire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Or again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Our passions breathe their own wild harmony,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pour out music at a clinging kiss.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing on, O Soul, our lyric of desire,</div>
      <div class='line'>For God Himself is in the melody.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the author of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Baisers</span></i>, always
elegantly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terre-à-terre</span></i>, formulates his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>more concrete desires in an Alexandrine
worthy of Racine:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Viens. Je veux dégrafer moi-même ton corsage.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The desire to involve the cosmos in our
emotions is by no means confined to the
poetess of <i>Songs of Love and Life</i>. In certain
cases we are all apt to invoke the universe
in an attempt to explain and account
for emotions whose intensity seems almost
inexplicable. This is particularly true of
the emotions aroused in us by the contemplation
of beauty. Why we should feel so
strongly when confronted with certain forms
and colours, certain sounds, certain verbal
suggestions of form and harmony—why the
thing which we call beauty should move us
at all—goodness only knows. In order to
explain the phenomenon, poets have involved
the universe in the matter, asserting that they
are moved by the contemplation of physical
beauty because it is the symbol of the divine.
The intensities of physical passion
have presented the same problem. Ashamed
of admitting that such feelings can have a
purely sublunary cause, we affirm, like the
Australian poetess, that “God Himself is in
the melody.” That, we argue, can be the
only explanation for the violence of the emotion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>This view of the matter is particularly
common in a country with fundamental puritanic
traditions like England, where the dry,
matter-of-fact attitude of the French seems
almost shocking. The puritan feels bound
to justify the facts of beauty and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volupté</span></i>.
They must be in some way made moral before
he can accept them. The French unpuritanic
mind accepts the facts as they are
tendered to it by experience, at their face
value.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='14'>XIV</abbr>: HOW THE DAYS DRAW IN!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The autumn equinox is close upon us
with all its presages of mortality, a
shortening day, a colder and longer night.
How the days draw in! Fear of ridicule
hardly allows one to make the melancholy
constatation. It is a conversational gambit
that, like fool’s mate, can only be used
against the simplest and least experienced of
players. And yet how much of the world’s
most moving poetry is nothing but a variation
on the theme of this in-drawing day!
The certainty of death has inspired more
poetry than the hope of immortality. The
visible transience of frail and lovely matter
has impressed itself more profoundly on
the mind of man than the notion of spiritual
permanence.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That is an article of faith from which nobody
can withhold assent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of late I have found myself almost incapable
of enjoying any poetry whose inspiration
is not despair or melancholy. Why, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>hardly know. Perhaps it is due to the
chronic horror of the political situation. For
heaven knows, that is quite sufficient to account
for a taste for melancholy verse.
The subject of any European government
to-day feels all the sensations of Gulliver in
the paws of the Queen of Brobdingnag’s
monkey—the sensations of some small and
helpless being at the mercy of something
monstrous and irresponsible and idiotic.
There sits the monkey “on the ridge of a
building five hundred yards above the
ground, holding us like a baby in one of his
fore paws.” Will he let go? Will he
squeeze us to death? The best we can hope
for is to be “let drop on a ridge tile,” with
only enough bruises to keep one in bed for
a fortnight. But it seems very unlikely that
some “honest lad will climb up and, putting
us in his breeches pocket, bring us down
safe.” However, I divagate a little from my
subject, which is the poetry of melancholy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some day I shall compile an Oxford Book
of Depressing Verse, which shall contain
nothing but the most magnificent expressions
of melancholy and despair. All the obvious
people will be in it and as many of the obscure
apostles of gloom as vague and miscellaneous
reading shall have made known to
me. A duly adequate amount of space, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>example, will be allotted to that all but
great poet, Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke.
For dark magnificence there are not many
things that can rival that summing up
against life and human destiny at the end of
his “Mustapha.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Like most of his contemporaries in those
happy days before the notion of progress
had been invented, Lord Brooke was what
Peacock would have called a “Pejorationist.”
His political views (and they were
also Sidney’s) are reflected in his <i>Life of
Sir Philip Sidney</i>. The best that a statesman
can do, according to these Elizabethan
pessimists, is to patch and prop the decaying
fabric of society in the hope of staving off
for a little longer the final inevitable crash.
It seems curious to us, who have learnt to
look at the Elizabethan age as the most
splendid in English history, that the men
who were the witnesses of these splendours
should have regarded their time as an age
of decadence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The notion of the Fall was fruitful in
despairing poetry. One of the most remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>products of this doctrine is a certain

depressing process of decay? It may be that
the poetry of melancholy and despair is destined
to lose its place in literature, and that
a spirit of what William James called
“healthy-mindedness” will inherit its kingdom.
Many “eternal truths” have already
found their way on to the dust-heap of antiquated
ideas. It may be that this last and

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='15'>XV</abbr>: TIBET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In moments of complete despair, when it
seems that all is for the worst in the worst
of all possible worlds, it is cheering to discover
that there are places where stupidity
reigns even more despotically than in Western
Europe, where civilization is based on
principles even more fantastically unreasonable.
Recent experience has shown me that
the depression into which the Peace, Mr.
Churchill, the state of contemporary literature,
have conspired to plunge the mind, can
be sensibly relieved by a study, even superficial,
of the manners and customs of Tibet.
The spectacle of an ancient and elaborate
civilization of which almost no detail is not
entirely idiotic is in the highest degree comforting
and refreshing. It fills us with hopes
of the ultimate success of our own civilization;
it restores our wavering self-satisfaction
in being citizens of industrialized Europe.
Compared with Tibet, we are prodigious.
Let us cherish the comparison.</p>

<p class='c013'>My informant about Tibetan civilization
is a certain Japanese monk of the name of
Kawaguchi, who spent three years in Tibet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>at the beginning of the present century. His
account of the experience has been translated
into English, and published, with the
title <i>Three Years in Tibet</i>, by the Theosophical
Society. It is one of the great travel
books of the world, and, so far as I am aware,
the most interesting book on Tibet that exists.
Kawaguchi enjoyed opportunities in
Tibet which no European traveller could possibly
have had. He attended the University
of Lhasa, he enjoyed the acquaintance of the
Dalai Lama himself, he was intimate with
one of the four Ministers of Finance, he was
the friend of lama and layman, of all sorts
and conditions of Tibetans, from the highest
class to the lowest—the despicable caste of
smiths and butchers. He knew his Tibet intimately;
for those three years, indeed, he
was for all practical purposes a Tibetan.
This is something which no European explorer
can claim, and it is this which gives
Kawaguchi’s book its unique interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Japanese, like people of every other
nationality except the Chinese, are not permitted
to enter Tibet. Mr. Kawaguchi did
not allow this to stand in the way of his
pious mission—for his purpose in visiting
Tibet was to investigate the Buddhist writings
and traditions of the place. He made
his way to India, and in a long stay at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Darjeeling familiarized himself with the
Tibetan language. He then set out to walk
across the Himalayas. Not daring to affront
the strictly guarded gates which bar the direct
route to Lhasa, he penetrated Tibet at its
southwestern corner, underwent prodigious
hardships in an uninhabited desert eighteen
thousand feet above sea-level, visited the
holy lake of Manosarovara, and finally,
after astonishing adventures, arrived in
Lhasa. Here he lived for nearly three years,
passing himself off as a Chinaman. At the
end of that time his secret leaked out, and
he was obliged to accelerate his departure
for India. So much for Kawaguchi himself,
though I should have liked to say more of
him; for a more charming and sympathetic
character never revealed himself in a book.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tibet is so full of fantastic low comedy
that one hardly knows where to begin a catalogue
of its absurdities. Shall we start with
the Tibetans’ highly organized service of
trained nurses, whose sole duty it is to prevent
their patients from going to sleep? or
with the Dalai Lama’s chief source of income—the
sale of pills made of dung, at,
literally, a guinea a box? or with the Tibetan
custom of never washing from the moment
of birth, when, however, they are plentifully
anointed with melted butter, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>moment of death? And then there is the
University of Lhasa, which an eminent Cambridge
philosopher has compared with the
University of Oxford—somewhat unjustly,
perhaps; but let that pass. At the University
of Lhasa the student is instructed in logic
and philosophy; every year of his stay he
has to learn by heart from one to five or six
hundred pages of holy texts. He is also
taught mathematics, but in Tibet this art is
not carried farther than subtraction. It
takes twenty years to get a degree at the
University of Lhasa—twenty years, and
then most of the candidates are ploughed.
To obtain a superior Ph.D. degree, entitling
one to become a really holy and eminent
lama, forty years of application to study and
to virtue are required. But it is useless to
try to make a catalogue of the delights of
Tibet. There are too many of them for mention
in this small space. One can do no
more than glance at a few of the brighter
spots in the system.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is much to be said for the Tibetan
system of taxation. The Government requires
a considerable revenue; for enormous
sums have to be spent in keeping perpetually
burning in the principal Buddhist cathedral
of Lhasa an innumerable army of lamps,
which may not be fed with anything cheaper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>than clarified yak butter. This is the heaviest
item of expenditure. But a great deal of
money also goes to supporting the Tibetan
clergy, who must number at least a sixth of
the total population. The money is raised
by a poll tax, paid in kind, the amount of
which, fixed by ancient tradition, may, theoretically,
never be altered. Theoretically
only; for the Tibetan Government employs
in the collection of taxes no fewer than
twenty different standards of weight and
thirty-six different standards of measure.
The pound may weigh anything from half
to a pound and a half; and the same with the
units of measure. It is thus possible to calculate
with extraordinary nicety, according
to the standard of weight and measure in
which your tax is assessed, where precisely
you stand in the Government’s favour. If
you are a notoriously bad character, or even
if you are innocent, but live in a bad district,
your tax will have to be paid in measures of
the largest size. If you are virtuous, or, better,
if you are rich, of good family and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien
pensant</span></i>, then you will pay by weights
which are only half the nominal weight.
For those whom the Government neither
hates nor loves, but regards with more or less
contempt or tolerance, there are the thirty-four
intervening degrees.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Kawaguchi’s final judgment of the Tibetans,
after three years’ intimate acquaintance
with them, is not a flattering one:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>The Tibetans are characterized by four serious
defects, these being: filthiness, superstition, unnatural
customs (such as polyandry), and unnatural
art. I should be sorely perplexed if I were asked
to name their redeeming points; but if I had to do
so, I should mention first of all the fine climate in
the vicinity of Lhasa and Shigatze, their sonorous
and refreshing voices in reading the Text, the animated
style of their catechisms, and their ancient
art.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Certainly a bad lot of vices; but then the
Tibetan virtues are not lightly to be set aside.
We English possess none of them: our climate
is abominable, our method of reading
the holy texts is painful in the extreme, our
catechisms, at least in my young days, were
far from animated, and our ancient art is
very indifferent stuff. But still, in spite of
these defects, in spite of Mr. Churchill and
the state of contemporary literature, we can
still look at the Tibetans and feel reassured.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='16'>XVI</abbr>: BEAUTY IN 1920</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To those who know how to read the signs
of the times it will have become apparent,
in the course of these last days and
weeks, that the Silly Season is close upon us.
Already—and this in July with the menace
of three or four new wars grumbling on the
thunderous horizon—already a monster of
the deep has appeared at a popular seaside
resort. Already Mr. Louis McQuilland has
launched in the <i>Daily Express</i> a fierce onslaught
on the younger poets of the Asylum.
Already the picture-papers are more than
half filled with photographs of bathing
nymphs—photographs that make one understand
the ease with which St. Anthony rebuffed
his temptations. The newspapermen,
ramping up and down like wolves, seek
their prey wherever they may find it; and it
was with a unanimous howl of delight that
the whole Press went pelting after the hare
started by Mrs. Asquith in a recent instalment
of her autobiography. Feebly and belatedly,
let me follow the pack.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Asquith’s denial of beauty to the
daughters of the twentieth century has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>proved a god-sent giant gooseberry. It has
necessitated the calling in of a whole host of
skin-food specialists, portrait-painters and
photographers to deny this far from soft impeachment.
A great deal of space has been
agreeably and inexpensively filled. Every
one is satisfied, public, editors, skin-food
specialists and all. But by far the most interesting
contribution to the debate was a
pictorial one, which appeared, if I remember
rightly, in the <i>Daily News</i>. Side by side, on
the same page, we were shown the photographs
of three beauties of the eighteen-eighties
and three of the nineteen-twenties.
The comparison was most instructive. For
a great gulf separates the two types of
beauty represented by these two sets of photographs.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remember in <i>If</i>, one of those charming
conspiracies of E. V. Lucas and George Morrow,
a series of parodied fashion-plates entitled
“If Faces get any Flatter. Last year’s
standard, this year’s Evening Standard.”
The faces of our living specimens of beauty
have grown flatter with those of their fashion-plate
sisters. Compare the types of 1880
and 1920. The first is steep-faced, almost
Roman in profile; in the contemporary beauties
the face has broadened and shortened,
the profile is less noble, less imposing, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>appealingly, more alluringly pretty. Forty
years ago it was the aristocratic type that was
appreciated; to-day the popular taste has
shifted from the countess to the soubrette.
Photography confirms the fact that the ladies
of the ’eighties looked like Du Maurier drawings.
But among the present young generation
one looks in vain for the type; the Du
Maurier damsel is as extinct as the mesozoic
reptile; the Fish girl and other kindred flat-faced
species have taken her place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between the ’thirties and ’fifties another
type, the egg-faced girl, reigned supreme in
the affections of the world. From the early
portraits of Queen Victoria to the fashion-plates
in the <i>Ladies’ Keepsake</i> this invariable
type prevails—the egg-shaped face, the sleek
hair, the swan-like neck, the round, champagne-bottle
shoulders. Compared with the
decorous impassivity of the oviform girl our
flat-faced fashion-plates are terribly abandoned
and provocative. And because one expects
so much in the way of respectability
from these egg-faces of an earlier age, one is
apt to be shocked when one sees them conducting
themselves in ways that seem unbefitting.
One thinks of that enchanting picture
of Etty’s, “Youth on the Prow and
Pleasure at the Helm.” The naiads are of
the purest egg-faced type. Their hair is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>sleek, their shoulders slope and their faces are
as impassive as blanks. And yet they have
no clothes on. It is almost indecent; one imagined
that the egg-faced type came into the
world complete with flowing draperies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not only the face of beauty that alters
with the changes of popular taste. The
champagne-bottle shoulders of the oviform
girl have vanished from the modern fashion-plate
and from modern life. The contemporary
hand, with its two middle fingers held
together and the forefinger and little finger
splayed apart, is another recent product.
Above all, the feet have changed. In the
days of the egg-faces no fashion-plate had
more than one foot. This rule will, I think,
be found invariable. That solitary foot projects,
generally in a strangely haphazard way
as though it had nothing to do with a leg,
from under the edge of the skirt. And what
a foot! It has no relation to those provocative
feet in Suckling’s ballad:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her feet beneath her petticoat</div>
      <div class='line'>Like little mice stole in and out.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is an austere foot. It is a small, black,
oblong object like a tea-leaf. No living human
being has ever seen a foot like it, for it
is utterly unlike the feet of nineteen-twenty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>To-day the fashion-plate is always a biped.
The tea-leaf has been replaced by two feet
of rich baroque design, curved and florid,
with insteps like the necks of Arab horses.
Faces may have changed shape, but feet have
altered far more radically. On the text, “the
feet of the young women,” it would be possible
to write a profound philosophical
sermon.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while I am on the subject of feet I
would like to mention another curious phenomenon
of the same kind, but affecting, this
time, the standards of male beauty. Examine
the pictorial art of the eighteenth century,
and you will find that the shape of the
male leg is not what it was. In those days
the calf of the leg was not a muscle that
bulged to its greatest dimensions a little below
the back of the knee, to subside, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">decrescendo</span></i>,
towards the ankle. No, in the eighteenth
century the calf was an even crescent,
with its greatest projection opposite the middle
of the shin; the ankle, as we know it,
hardly existed. This curious calf is forced
upon one’s attention by almost every minor
picture-maker of the eighteenth century, and
even by some of the great masters, as, for
instance, Blake. How it came into existence
I do not know. Presumably the crescent calf
was considered, in the art schools, to approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>more nearly to the Platonic Idea of
the human leg than did the poor distorted
Appearance of real life. Personally, I prefer
my calves with the bulge at the top and a
proper ankle at the bottom. But then I don’t
hold much with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The process by which one type of beauty
becomes popular, imposes its tyranny for a
period and then is displaced by a dissimilar
type is a mysterious one. It may be that patient
historical scholars will end by discovering
some law to explain the transformation
of the Du Maurier type into the flat-face
type, the tea-leaf foot into the baroque foot,
the crescent calf into the normal calf. As
far as one can see at present, these changes
seem to be the result of mere hazard and arbitrary
choice. But a time will doubtless come
when it will be found that these changes of
taste are as ineluctably predetermined as any
chemical change. Given the South African
War, the accession of Edward <span class='fss'>VII.</span> and the
Liberal triumph of 1906, it was, no doubt, as
inevitable that Du Maurier should have
given place to Fish as that zinc subjected to
sulphuric acid should break up into ZnSO4 +
H2. But we leave it to others to formulate
the precise workings of the law.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='17'>XVII</abbr>: GREAT THOUGHTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To all lovers of unfamiliar quotations,
aphorisms, great thoughts and intellectual
gems, I would heartily recommend a
heavy volume recently published in Brussels
and entitled <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pensées sur la Science, la Guerre
et sur des sujets très variés</span></i>. The book contains
some twelve or thirteen thousand quotations,
selected from a treasure of one hundred
and twenty-three thousand great
thoughts gleaned and garnered by the industry
of Dr. Maurice Legat—an industry
which will be appreciated at its value by any
one who has ever made an attempt to compile
a commonplace book or private anthology
of his own. The almost intolerable labour
of copying out extracts can only be
avoided by the drastic use of the scissors;
and there are few who can afford the luxury
of mutilating their copies of the best authors.</p>

<p class='c013'>For some days I made Dr. Legat’s book
my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livre de chevet</span></i>. But I had very soon to
give up reading it at night, for I found that
the Great often said things so peculiar that
I was kept awake in the effort to discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>their meaning. Why, for example, should it
be categorically stated by Lamennais that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“si
les animaux connaissaient Dieu, ils parleraient”</span>?
What could Cardinal Maury
have meant when he said, “L’éloquence,
compagne ordinaire de la liberté [astonishing
generalization!], est inconnue en Angleterre”?
These were mysteries insoluble
enough to counteract the soporific effects of
such profound truths as this, discovered, apparently,
in 1846 by Monsieur C. H. D.
Duponchel, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le plus sage mortel est sujet à
l’erreur.”</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Legat has found some pleasing quotations
on the subject of England and the English.
His selection proves with what fatal
ease even the most intelligent minds are
lured into making generalizations about national
character, and how grotesque those
generalizations always are. Montesquieu informs
us that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“dès que sa fortune se délabre,
un anglais tue ou se fait voleur.”</span> Of the
better half of this potential murderer and
robber Balzac says, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La femme anglaise est
une pauvre créature verteuse par force, prête
à se dépraver.”</span> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La vanité est l’âme de
toute société anglaise,”</span> says Lamartine.
Ledru-Rollin is of opinion that all the riches
of England are <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“des dépouilles volées aux
tombeaux.”</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The Goncourts risk a characteristically
dashing generalization on the national characters
of England and France: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’Anglais,
filou comme peuple, est honnête comme individu.
Il est le contraire du Français, honnête
comme peuple, et filou comme individu.”</span>
If one is going to make a comparison Voltaire’s
is more satisfactory because less pretentious.
Strange are the ways of you Englishmen,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is unfortunate that history should have
vitiated the truth of this pithy and pregnant
statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the bright spots in this enormous tome
are rare. After turning over a few hundred
pages one is compelled, albeit reluctantly, to
admit that the Great Thought or Maxim is
nearly the most boring form of literature that
exists. Others, it seems, have anticipated
me in this grand discovery. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Las de m’ennuyer
des pensées des autres,”</span> says d’Alembert,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“j’ai voulu leur donner les miennes;
mais je puis me flatter de leur avoir rendu
tout l’ennui que j’avais reçu d’eux.”</span> Almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>next to d’Alembert’s statement I find this
confession from the pen of J. Roux (1834-1906):
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Emettre des pensées, voilà ma consolation,
mon délice, ma vie!”</span> Happy Monsieur
Roux!</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning dissatisfied from Dr. Legat’s anthology
of thought, I happened upon the second
number of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Proverbe</span></i>, a monthly review,
four pages in length, directed by M. Paul
Eluard and counting among its contributors
Tristan Tzara of <i>Dada</i> fame, Messrs. Soupault,
Breton and Aragon, the directors of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Littérature</span></i>, M. Picabia, M. Ribemont-Dessaignes
and others of the same kidney.
Here, on the front page of the March number
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Proverbe</span></i>, I found the very comment
on Great Thoughts for which I had, in my
dissatisfaction, been looking. The following
six maxims are printed one below the
other: the first of them is a quotation from
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Intransigeant</span></i>; the other five appear to
be the work of M. Tzara, who appends a
footnote to this effect: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Je m’appelle dorénavant
exclusivement Monsieur Paul Bourget.”</span>
Here they are:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut violer les règles, oui, mais pour les violer
il faut les connaître.</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut régler la connaissance, oui, mais pour la
régler il faut la violer.</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut connaître les viols, oui, mais pour les
connaître il faut les régler.</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut connaître les règles, oui, mais pour les

il faut les connaître.</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut violer la connaissance, oui, mais pour la
violer il faut la régler.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>It is to be hoped that Dr. Legat will find
room for at least a selection of these profound
thoughts in the next edition of his
book. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<span class='sc'>Le</span> passé et <span class='sc'>La</span> pensée n’existent
pas,”</span> affirms M. Raymond Duncan on another
page of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Proverbe</span></i>. It is precisely after
taking too large a dose of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Pensées sur la
Science, la Guerre et sur des sujets très
variés”</span> that one half wishes the statement
were in fact true.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='18'>XVIII</abbr>: ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I have always been interested in the
subtleties of literary form. This preoccupation
with the outward husk, with the
letter of literature, is, I dare say, the sign of
a fundamental spiritual impotence. Gigadibs,
the literary man, can understand the
tricks of the trade; but when it is a question,
not of conjuring, but of miracles, he is no
more effective than Mr. Sludge. Still, conjuring
is amusing to watch and to practise;
an interest in the machinery of the art requires
no further justification. I have dallied
with many literary forms, taking pleasure
in their different intricacies, studying the
means by which great authors of the past
have resolved the technical problems presented
by each. Sometimes I have even tried
my hand at solving the problems myself—delightful
and salubrious exercise for the
mind. And now I have discovered the most
exciting, the most arduous literary form of
all, the most difficult to master, the most
pregnant in curious possibilities. I mean the
advertisement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nobody who has not tried to write an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>advertisement has any idea of the delights
and difficulties presented by this form of
literature—or shall I say of “applied literature,”
for the sake of those who still believe
in the romantic superiority of the pure, the
disinterested, over the immediately useful?
The problem that confronts the writer of
advertisements is an immensely complicated
one, and by reason of its very arduousness
immensely interesting. It is far easier to
write ten passably effective Sonnets, good
enough to take in the not too inquiring critic,
than one effective advertisement that will
take in a few thousand of the uncritical buying
public. The problem presented by the
Sonnet is child’s play compared with the
problem of the advertisement. In writing a
Sonnet one need think only of oneself. If
one’s readers find one boring or obscure, so
much the worse for them. But in writing an
advertisement one must think of other people.
Advertisement writers may not be
lyrical, or obscure, or in any way esoteric.
They must be universally intelligible. A
good advertisement has this in common with
drama and oratory, that it must be immediately
comprehensible and directly moving.
But at the same time it must possess all the
succinctness of epigram.</p>

<p class='c013'>The orator and the dramatist have “world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>enough and time” to produce their effects by
cumulative appeals; they can turn all round
their subject, they can repeat; between the
heights of their eloquence they can gracefully
practise the art of sinking, knowing that
a period of flatness will only set off the
splendour of their impassioned moments.
But the advertiser has no space to spare; he
pays too dearly for every inch. He must
play upon the minds of his audience with
a small and limited instrument. He must
persuade them to part with their money in a
speech that is no longer than many a lyric
by Herrick. Could any problem be more
fascinatingly difficult? No one should be
allowed to talk about the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot juste</span></i> or the
polishing of style who has not tried his hand
at writing an advertisement of something
which the public does not want, but which
it must be persuaded into buying. Your
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boniment</span></i> must not exceed a poor hundred
and fifty or two hundred words. With what
care you must weigh every syllable! What
infinite pains must be taken to fashion every
phrase into a barbed hook that shall stick in
the reader’s mind and draw from its hiding-place
within his pocket the reluctant coin!
One’s style and ideas must be lucid and simple
enough to be understood by all; but at
the same time, they must not be vulgar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Elegance and an economical distinction are
required; but any trace of literariness in an
advertisement is fatal to its success.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not know whether any one has yet
written a history of advertising. If the book
does not already exist it will certainly have
to be written. The story of the development
of advertising from its infancy in the early
nineteenth century to its luxuriant maturity
in the twentieth is an essential chapter in
the history of democracy. Advertisement begins
abjectly, crawling on its belly like the
serpent after the primal curse. Its abjection
is the oily humbleness of the shopkeeper in
an oligarchical society. Those nauseating
references to the nobility and clergy, which
are the very staple of early advertisements,
are only possible in an age when the aristocracy
and its established Church effectively
ruled the land. The custom of invoking
these powers lingered on long after they had
ceased to hold sway. It is now, I fancy, almost
wholly extinct. It may be that certain
old-fashioned girls’ schools still provide education
for the daughters of the nobility and
clergy; but I am inclined to doubt it. Advertisers
still find it worth while to parade
the names and escutcheons of kings. But
anything less than royalty is, frankly, a
“wash-out.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The crawling style of advertisement with
its mixture of humble appeals to patrons and
its hyperbolical laudation of the goods advertised,
was early varied by the pseudo-scientific
style, a simple development of the
quack’s patter at the fair. Balzacians will
remember the advertisement composed by
Finot and the Illustrious Gaudissard for
César Birotteau’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Huile Céphalique.”</span> The
type is not yet dead; we still see advertisements
of substances “based on the principles
established by the Academy of Sciences,”
substances known “to the ancients, the Romans,
the Greeks and the nations of the
North,” but lost and only rediscovered by the
advertiser. The style and manner of these advertisements
belonging to the early and middle
periods of the Age of Advertisement continue
to bear the imprint of the once despicable
position of commerce. They are written
with the impossible and insincere unctuousness
of tradesmen’s letters. They are horribly
uncultured; and when their writers aspire
to something more ambitious than the counting-house
style, they fall at once into the
stilted verbiage of self-taught learning.
Some of the earlier efforts to raise the tone
of advertisements are very curious. One remembers
those remarkable full-page advertisements
of Eno’s Fruit Salt, loaded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>weighty apophthegms from Emerson, Epictetus,
Zeno the Eleatic, Pomponazzi, Slawkenbergius
and other founts of human wisdom.
There was noble reading on these
strange pages. But they shared with sermons
the defect of being a little dull.</p>

<p class='c013'>The art of advertisement writing has flowered
with democracy. The lords of industry
and commerce came gradually to understand
that the right way to appeal to the Free Peoples
of the World was familiarly, in an honest
man-to-man style. They perceived that
exaggeration and hyperbole do not really
pay, that charlatanry must at least have an
air of sincerity. They confided in the public,
they appealed to its intelligence in every kind
of flattering way. The technique of the art
became at once immensely more difficult than
it had ever been before, until now the advertisement
is, as I have already hinted, one
of the most interesting and difficult of modern
literary forms. Its potentialities are not
yet half explored. Already the most interesting
and, in some cases, the only readable
part of most American periodicals is the advertisement
section. What does the future
hold in store?</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='19'>XIX</abbr>: EUPHUES REDIVIVUS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I have recently been fortunate in securing
a copy of that very rare and precious
novel <i>Delina Delaney</i>, by Amanda M. Ros,
authoress of <i>Irene Iddesleigh</i> and <i>Poems of
Puncture</i>. Mrs. Ros’s name is only known
to a small and select band of readers. But
by these few she is highly prized; one of her
readers, it is said, actually was at the pains
to make a complete manuscript copy of <i>Delina
Delaney</i>, so great was his admiration and
so hopelessly out of print the book. Let me
recommend the volume, Mrs. Ros’s masterpiece,
to the attention of enterprising publishers.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delina Delaney</i> opens with a tremendous,
an almost, in its richness of vituperative eloquence,
Rabelaisian denunciation of Mr.
Barry Pain, who had, it seems, treated
<i>Irene Iddesleigh</i> with scant respect in his
review of the novel in <i>Black and White</i>.
“This so-called Barry Pain, by name, has
taken upon himself to criticize a work, the
depth of which fails to reach the solving
power of his borrowed, and, he’d have you
believe, varied talent.” But “I care not for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the opinion of half-starved upstarts, who don
the garb of a shabby-genteel, and fain would
feed the mind of the people with the worthless
scraps of stolen fancies.” So perish all
reviewers! And now for Delina herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The story is a simple one. Delina Delaney,
daughter of a fisherman, loves and is
loved by Lord Gifford. The baleful influence
of a dark-haired Frenchwoman, Madame
de Maine, daughter of the Count-av-Nevo,
comes between the lovers and their
happiness, and Delina undergoes fearful torments,
including three years’ penal servitude,
before their union can take place. It
is the manner, rather than the matter, of the
book which is remarkable. Here, for instance,
is a fine conversation between Lord
Gifford and his mother, an aristocratic dame
who strenuously objects to his connection
with Delina. Returning one day to Columba
Castle she hears an unpleasant piece of news:
her son has been seen kissing Delina in the
conservatory.</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>“Home again, mother?” he boldly uttered, as he
gazed reverently in her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Home to Hades!” returned the raging high-bred
daughter of distinguished effeminacy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah me! what is the matter?” meekly inquired
his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything is the matter with a broken-hearted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>mother of low-minded offspring,” she answered
hotly.... “Henry Edward Ludlow Gifford, son
of my strength, idolized remnant of my inert husband,
who at this moment invisibly offers the
scourging whip of fatherly authority to your backbone
of resentment (though for years you think
him dead to your movements) and pillar of maternal
trust.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Poor Lady Gifford! her son’s behaviour
was her undoing. The shock caused her to
lose first her reason and then her life. Her
son was heart-broken at the thought that he
was responsible for her downfall:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>“Is it true, O Death,” I cried in my agony, “that
you have wrested from me my mother, Lady Gifford
of Columba Castle, and left me here, a unit figuring
on the great blackboard of the past, the shaky
surface of the present and fickle field of the future
to track my life-steps, with gross indifference to
her wished-for wish?”... Blind she lay to the
presence of her son, who charged her death-gun with
the powder of accelerated wrath.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>It is impossible to suppose that Mrs. Ros
can ever have read <i>Euphues</i> or the earlier
romances of Robert Greene. How then shall
we account for the extraordinary resemblance
to Euphuism of her style? how explain those
rich alliterations, those elaborate “kennings”
and circumlocutions of which the fabric of
her book is woven? Take away from Lyly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>his erudition and his passion for antithesis,
and you have Mrs. Ros. Delina is own sister
to Euphues and Pandosto. The fact is
that Mrs. Ros happens, though separated
from Euphuism by three hundred years and
more, to have arrived independently at precisely
the same stage of development as Lyly
and his disciples. It is possible to see in a
growing child a picture in miniature of all the
phases through which humanity has passed
in its development. And, in the same way,
the mind of an individual (especially when
that individual has been isolated from the
main current of contemporary thought) may
climb, alone, to a point at which, in the past,
a whole generation has rested. In Mrs. Ros
we see, as we see in the Elizabethan novelists,
the result of the discovery of art by an unsophisticated
mind and of its first conscious
attempt to produce the artistic. It is remarkable
how late in the history of every
literature simplicity is invented. The first
attempts of any people to be consciously literary
are always productive of the most elaborate
artificiality. Poetry is always written
before prose and always in a language as remote
as possible from the language of ordinary
life. The language and versification of
“Beowulf” are far more artificial and remote
from life than those of, say, <i>The Rape of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Lock</i>. The Euphuists were not barbarians
making their first discovery of literature;
they were, on the contrary, highly educated.
But in one thing they were unsophisticated:
they were discovering prose.
They were realizing that prose could be written
with art, and they wrote it as artificially
as they possibly could, just as their Saxon
ancestors wrote poetry. They became intoxicated
with their discovery of artifice. It was
some time before the intoxication wore off
and men saw that art was possible without
artifice. Mrs. Ros, an Elizabethan born out
of her time, is still under the spell of that
magical and delicious intoxication.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Ros’s artifices are often more remarkable
and elaborate even than Lyly’s. This is
how she tells us that Delina earned money
by doing needlework:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>She tried hard to keep herself a stranger to her
poor old father’s slight income by the use of the
finest production of steel, whose blunt edge eyed the
reely covering with marked greed, and offered its
sharp dart to faultless fabrics of flaxen fineness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>And Lord Gifford parts from Delina in
these words:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>I am just in time to hear the toll of a parting
bell strike its heavy weight of appalling softness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>against the weakest fibres of a heart of love, arousing
and tickling its dormant action, thrusting the
dart of evident separation deeper into its tubes of
tenderness, and fanning the flame, already unextinguishable,
into volumes of burning blaze.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>But more often Mrs. Ros does not exceed
the bounds which Lyly set for himself.
Here, for instance, is a sentence that might
have come direct out of <i>Euphues</i>:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Two days after, she quit Columba Castle and resolved
to enter the holy cloisters of a convent,
where, she believed she’d be dead to the built hopes
of wealthy worth, the crooked steps to worldly distinction,
and the designing creaks [<i>sic</i>] in the
muddy stream of love.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Or again, this description of the artful
charmers who flaunt along the streets of London
is written in the very spirit and language
of <i>Euphues</i>:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>Their hair was a light-golden colour, thickly
fringed in front, hiding in many cases the furrows
of a life of vice; behind, reared coils, some of which
differed in hue, exhibiting the fact that they were
on patrol for the price of another supply of dye....
The elegance of their attire had the glow of
robbery—the rustle of many a lady’s silent curse.
These tools of brazen effrontery were strangers to
the blush of innocence that tinged many a cheek, as
they would gather round some of God’s ordained,
praying in flowery words of decoying Cockney, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>they should break their holy vows by accompanying
them to the halls of adultery. Nothing daunted at
the staunch refusal of different divines, whose modest
walk was interrupted by their bold assertion
of loathsome rights, they moved on, while laughs
of hidden rage and defeat flitted across their doll-decked
faces, to die as they next accosted some
rustic-looking critics, who, tempted with their polished
twang, their earnest advances, their pitiful
entreaties, yielded, in their ignorance of the ways
of a large city, to their glossy offers, and accompanied,
with slight hesitation, these artificial shells
of immorality to their homes of ruin, degradation
and shame.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='20'>XX</abbr>: THE AUTHOR OF <i>EMINENT VICTORIANS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A superlatively civilized Red Indian
living apart from the vulgar world
in an elegant and park-like reservation, Mr.
Strachey rarely looks over his walls at the
surrounding country. It seethes, he knows,
with crowds of horribly colonial persons.
Like the hosts of Midian, the innumerable
“poor whites” prowl and prowl around, but
the noble savage pays no attention to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his spiritual home—a neat and commodious
Georgian mansion in the style of
Leoni or Ware—he sits and reads, he turns
over portfolios of queer old prints, he savours
meditatively the literary vintages of
centuries. And occasionally, once in two or
three years, he tosses over his park palings a
record of these leisured degustations, a judgment
passed upon his library, a ripe rare
book. One time it is Eminent Victorians;
the next it is Queen Victoria herself. To-day
he has given us a miscellaneous collection
of <i>Books and Characters</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>If Voltaire had lived to the age of two
hundred and thirty instead of shuffling off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>at a paltry eighty-four, he would have written
about the Victorian epoch, about life and
letters at large, very much as Mr. Strachey
has written. That lucid common sense, that
sharp illuminating wit which delight us in
the writings of the middle eighteenth century—these
are Mr. Strachey’s characteristics.
We know exactly what he would have
been if he had come into the world at the
beginning of the seventeen hundreds; if he
is different from the men of that date it is
because he happens to have been born towards
the end of the eighteens.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sum of knowledge at the disposal of
the old Encyclopædists was singularly small,
compared, that is to say, with the knowledge
which we of the twentieth century have inherited.
They made mistakes and in their
ignorance they passed what we can see to
have been hasty and very imperfect judgments
on men and things. Mr. Strachey is
the eighteenth century grown-up; he is Voltaire
at two hundred and thirty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voltaire at sixty would have treated the
Victorian era, if it could have appeared in
a prophetical vision before his eyes, in terms
of “La Pucelle”—with ribaldry. He would
have had to be much older in knowledge and
inherited experience before he could have approached
it in that spirit of sympathetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>irony and ironical sympathy which Mr.
Strachey brings to bear upon it. Mr.
Strachey makes us like the old Queen, while
we smile at her; he makes us admire the
Prince Consort in spite of the portentous
priggishness—duly insisted on in the biography—which
accompanied his intelligence.
With all the untutored barbarity of their notions,
Gordon and Florence Nightingale are
presented to us as sympathetic figures.
Their peculiar brand of religion and ethics
might be absurd, but their characters are
shown to be interesting and fine.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is only in the case of Dr. Arnold that
Mr. Strachey permits himself to be unrestrainedly
Voltairean; he becomes a hundred
and seventy years younger as he describes
the founder of the modern Public School system.
The irony of that description is tempered
by no sympathy. To make the man
appear even more ridiculous, Mr. Strachey
adds a stroke or two to the portrait of his
own contriving—little inventions which
deepen the absurdity of the caricature. Thus
we read that Arnold’s “outward appearance
was the index of his inward character. The
legs, perhaps, were shorter than they should
have been; but the sturdy athletic frame, especially
when it was swathed (as it usually
was) in the flowing robes of a Doctor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Divinity, was full of an imposing vigour.”
How exquisitely right those short legs are!
how artistically inevitable! Our admiration
for Mr. Strachey’s art is only increased
when we discover that in attributing to the
Doctor this brevity of shank he is justified
by no contemporary document. The short
legs are his own contribution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voltaire, then, at two hundred and thirty
has learned sympathy. He has learned that
there are other ways of envisaging life than
the common-sense, reasonable way and that
people with a crack-brained view of the universe
have a right to be judged as human
beings and must not be condemned out of
hand as lunatics or obscurantists. Blake and
St. Francis have as much right to their place
in the sun as Gibbon and Hume. But still,
in spite of this lesson, learned and inherited
from the nineteenth century, our Voltaire of
eleven score years and ten still shows a
marked preference for the Gibbons and the
Humes; he still understands their attitude
towards life a great deal better than he understands
the other fellow’s attitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his new volume of <i>Books and Characters</i>
Mr. Strachey prints an essay on Blake (written,
it may be added parenthetically, some
sixteen years ago), in which he sets out very
conscientiously to give that disquieting poet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>his due. The essay is interesting, not because
it contains anything particularly novel in the
way of criticism, but because it reveals, in
spite of all Mr. Strachey’s efforts to overcome
it, in spite of his admiration for the
great artist in Blake, his profound antagonism
towards Blake’s view of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>He cannot swallow mysticism; he finds it
clearly very difficult to understand what all
this fuss about the soul really signifies. The
man who believes in the absoluteness of good
and evil, who sees the universe as a spiritual
entity concerned, in some transcendental
fashion, with morality, the man who regards
the human spirit as possessing a somehow
cosmic importance and significance—ah no,
decidedly no, even at two hundred and thirty
Voltaire cannot whole-heartedly sympathize
with such a man.</p>

<p class='c013'>And that, no doubt, is the reason why Mr.
Strachey has generally shrunk from dealing,
in his biographies and his criticisms, with
any of these strange incomprehensible characters.
Blake is the only one he had tried
his hand on, and the result is not entirely
satisfactory. He is more at home with the
Gibbons and Humes of this world, and when
he is not discussing the reasonable beings he
likes to amuse himself with the eccentrics,
like Mr. Creevey or Lady Hester Stanhope.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The portentous, formidable mystics he leaves
severely alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>One cannot imagine Mr. Strachey coping
with Dostoevsky or with any of the other
great explorers of the soul. One cannot imagine
him writing a life of Beethoven.
These huge beings are disquieting for a Voltaire
who has learned enough sympathy to be
able to recognize their greatness, but whose
temperament still remains unalterably alien.
Mr. Strachey is wise to have nothing to do
with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second-rate mystics (I use the term
in its widest and vaguest sense), the men
who believe in the spirituality of the universe
and in the queerer dogmas which have
become tangled in that belief, without possessing
the genius which alone can justify
such notions in the eyes of the Voltaireans—these
are the objects on which Mr. Strachey
likes to turn his calm and penetrating gaze.
Gordon and Florence Nightingale, the
Prince Consort, Clough—they and their beliefs
are made to look rather absurd by the
time he has done with them. He reduces
their spiritual struggles to a series of the
most comically futile series of gymnastics in
the void. The men of genius who have gone
through the same spiritual struggles, who
have believed the same sort of creeds, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>had the unanswerable justification of their
genius. These poor absurd creatures have
not. Voltaire in his third century gives them
a certain amount of his newly learned sympathy;
but he also gives them a pretty strong
dose of his old irony.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='21'>XXI</abbr>: EDWARD THOMAS<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The poetry of Edward Thomas affects
one morally as well as æsthetically and
intellectually. We have grown rather shy,
in these days of pure æstheticism, of speaking
of those consoling or strengthening qualities
of poetry on which critics of another
generation took pleasure in dwelling.
Thomas’s poetry is strengthening and consoling,
not because it justifies God’s ways to
man or whispers of reunions beyond the
grave, not because it presents great moral
truths in memorable numbers, but in a more
subtle and very much more effective way.
Walking through the streets on these September
nights, one notices, wherever there are
trees along the street and lamps close beside
the trees, a curious and beautiful phenomenon.
The light of the street lamps striking
up into the trees has power to make the
grimed, shabby, and tattered foliage of the
all-but autumn seem brilliantly and transparently
green. Within the magic circle of
the light the tree seems to be at that crowning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>moment of the spring when the leaves
are fully grown, but still luminous with
youth and seemingly almost immaterial in
their lightness. Thomas’s poetry is to the
mind what that transfiguring lamplight is to
the tired trees. On minds grown weary in
the midst of the intolerable turmoil and
aridity of daily wage-earning existence, it
falls with a touch of momentary rejuvenation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The secret of Thomas’s influence lies in
the fact that he is genuinely what so many
others of our time quite unjustifiably claim
to be, a nature poet. To be a nature poet
it is not enough to affirm vaguely that God
made the country and man made the town,
it is not enough to talk sympathetically about
familiar rural objects, it is not enough to be
sonorously poetical about mountains and
trees; it is not even enough to speak of these
things with the precision of real knowledge
and love. To be a nature poet a man must
have felt profoundly and intimately those
peculiar emotions which nature can inspire,
and must be able to express them in such a
way that his reader feels them. The real
difficulty that confronts the would-be poet
of nature is that these emotions are of all
emotions the most difficult to pin down and
analyze, and the hardest of all to convey.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>In “October” Thomas describes what is
surely the characteristic emotion induced by
a contact with nature—a kind of exultant
melancholy which is the nearest approach to
quiet unpassionate happiness that the soul
can know. Happiness of whatever sort is
extraordinarily hard to analyze and describe.
One can think of a hundred poems, plays,
and novels that deal exhaustively with pain
and misery to one that is an analysis and an
infectious description of happiness. Passionate
joy is more easily recapturable in
art; it is dramatic, vehemently defined. But
quiet happiness, which is at the same time a
kind of melancholy—there you have an emotion
which is inexpressible except by a mind
gifted with a diversity of rarely combined
qualities. The poet who would sing of this
happiness must combine a rare penetration
with a rare candour and honesty of mind.
A man who feels an emotion that is very
difficult to express is often tempted to describe
it in terms of something entirely different.
Platonist poets feel a powerful emotion
when confronted by beauty, and, finding
it a matter of the greatest difficulty to
say precisely what that emotion is in itself,
proceed to describe it in terms of theology
which has nothing whatever to do with the
matter in point. Groping after an expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of the emotions aroused in him by the
contemplation of nature, Wordsworth sometimes
stumbles doubtfully along philosophical
byways that are at the best parallel
to the direct road for which he is seeking.
Everywhere in literature this difficulty in
finding an expression for any undramatic, ill-defined
emotion is constantly made apparent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thomas’s limpid honesty of mind saves
him from the temptation to which so many
others succumb, the temptation to express one
thing, because it is with difficulty describable,
in terms of something else. He never
philosophizes the emotions which he feels in
the presence of nature and beauty, but presents
them as they stand, transmitting them
directly to his readers without the interposition
of any obscuring medium. Rather than
attempt to explain the emotion, to rationalize
it into something that it is not, he will
present it for what it is, a problem of which
he does not know the solution. In “Tears”
we have an example of this candid confession
of ignorance:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It seems I have no tears left. They should have fallen—</div>
      <div class='line'>Their ghosts, if tears have ghosts, did fall—that day</div>
      <div class='line'>When twenty hounds streamed by me, not yet combed out</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>But still all equals in their age of gladness</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the scent, made one, like a great dragon</div>
      <div class='line'>In Blooming Meadow that bends towards the sun</div>
      <div class='line'>And once bore hops: and on that other day</div>
      <div class='line'>When I stepped out from the double-shadowed Tower</div>
      <div class='line'>Into an April morning, stirring and sweet</div>
      <div class='line'>And warm. Strange solitude was there and silence.</div>
      <div class='line'>A mightier charm than any in the Tower</div>
      <div class='line'>Possessed the courtyard. They were changing guard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soldiers in line, young English countrymen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair-haired and ruddy, in white tunics. Drums</div>
      <div class='line'>And fifes were playing “The British Grenadiers.”</div>
      <div class='line'>The men, the music piercing that solitude</div>
      <div class='line'>And silence, told me truths I had not dreamed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And have forgotten since their beauty passed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The emotion is nameless and indescribable,
but the poet has intensely felt it and transmitted
it to us who read his poem, so that
we, too, feel it with the same intensity.
Different aspects of this same nameless emotion
of quiet happiness shot with melancholy
are the theme of almost all Thomas’s poems.
They bring to us precisely that consolation
and strength which the country and solitude
and leisure bring to the spirits of those long
pent in populous cities, but essentialized and
distilled in the form of art. They are the light
that makes young again the tattered leaves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the purely æsthetic qualities of
Thomas’s poetry it is unnecessary to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>much. He devised a curiously bare and candid
verse to express with all possible simplicity
and clarity his clear sensations and
emotions.... “This is not,” as Mr. de la
Mare says in his foreword to Thomas’s <i>Collected
Poems</i>, “this is not a poetry that will
drug or intoxicate.... It must be read
slowly, as naturally as if it were prose, without
emphasis.” With this bare verse, devoid
of any affectation, whether of cleverness
or a too great simplicity, Thomas could
do all that he wanted. See, for example,
with what extraordinary brightness and precision
he could paint a picture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lichen, ivy and moss</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep evergreen the trees</div>
      <div class='line'>That stand half flayed and dying,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the dead trees on their knees</div>
      <div class='line'>In dog’s mercury and moss:</div>
      <div class='line'>And the bright twit of the goldfinch drops</div>
      <div class='line'>Down there as he flits on thistle-tops.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The same bare precision served him well for
describing the interplay of emotions, as in
“After you Speak” or “Like the Touch of
Rain.” And with this verse of his he could
also chant the praises of his English countryside
and the character of its people, as typified
in Lob-lie-by-the-fire:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>He has been in England as long as dove and daw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>The rose campion Bridget-in-her-bravery;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in a tender mood he, as I guess,</div>
      <div class='line'>Christened one flower Love-in-idleness....</div>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='22'>XXII</abbr>: A WORDSWORTH ANTHOLOGY<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To regard Wordsworth critically, impersonally,
is for some of us a rather difficult
matter. With the disintegration of
the solid orthodoxies Wordsworth became
for many intelligent, liberal-minded families
the Bible of that sort of pantheism, that dim
faith in the existence of a spiritual world,
which filled, somewhat inadequately, the
place of the older dogmas. Brought up as
children in the Wordsworthian tradition, we
were taught to believe that a Sunday walk
among the hills was somehow equivalent to
church-going: the First Lesson was to be read
among the clouds, the Second in the primroses;
the birds and the running waters sang
hymns, and the whole blue landscape
preached a sermon “of moral evil and of
good.” From this dim religious education
we brought away a not very well-informed
veneration for the name of Wordsworth, a
dutiful conviction about the spirituality of
Nature in general, and an extraordinary superstition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>about mountains in particular—a
superstition that it took at least three seasons
of Alpine Sports to dissipate entirely. Consequently,
on reaching man’s estate, when we
actually came to read our Wordsworth, we
found it extremely difficult to appraise his
greatness, so many veils of preconceived
ideas had to be pushed aside, so many inveterate
deflections of vision allowed for.
However, it became possible at last to look
at Wordsworth as a detached phenomenon
in the world of ideas and not as part of the
family tradition of childhood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like many philosophers, and especially
philosophers of a mystical tinge of thought,
Wordsworth based his philosophy on his
emotions. The conversion of emotions into
intellectual terms is a process that has been
repeated a thousand times in the history of
the human mind. We feel a powerful emotion
before a work of art, therefore it partakes
of the divine, is a reconstruction of the
Idea of which the natural object is a poor
reflection. Love moves us deeply, therefore
human love is a type of divine love. Nature
in her various aspects inspires us with
fear, joy, contentment, despair, therefore nature
is a soul that expresses anger, sympathy,
love, and hatred. One could go on indefinitely
multiplying examples of the way in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which man objectifies the kingdoms of
heaven and hell that are within him. The
process is often a dangerous one. The mystic
who feels within himself the stirrings of
inenarrable emotions is not content with
these emotions as they are in themselves.
He feels it necessary to invent a whole cosmogony
that will account for them. To him
this philosophy will be true, in so far as it is
an expression in intellectual terms of these
emotions. But to those who do not know
these emotions at first hand, it will be simply
misleading. The mystical emotions have
what may be termed a conduct value; they
enable the man who feels them to live his
life with a serenity and confidence unknown
to other men. But the philosophical terms
in which these emotions are expressed have
not necessarily any truth value. This mystical
philosophy will be valuable only in so
far as it revives, in the minds of its students,
those conduct-affecting emotions which originally
gave it birth. Accepted at its intellectual
face value, such a philosophy may not
only have no worth; it may be actually harmful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Into this beautifully printed volume Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson has gathered together
most of the passages in Wordsworth’s poetry
which possess the power of reviving the emotions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>that inspired them. It is astonishing
to find that they fill the best part of two
hundred and fifty pages, and that there are
still plenty of poems—“Peter Bell,” for example—that
one would like to see included.
“The Prelude” and “Excursion” yield a rich
tribute of what our ancestors would have
called “beauties.” There is that astonishing
passage in which the poet describes how, as
a boy, he rowed by moonlight across the
lake:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat</div>
      <div class='line'>Went heaving through the water like a swan;</div>
      <div class='line'>When, from behind that craggy steep till then</div>
      <div class='line'>The horizon’s bound, a huge peak, black and huge,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if with voluntary power instinct,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,</div>
      <div class='line'>And growing still in stature the grim shape</div>
      <div class='line'>Towered up between me and the stars, and still,</div>
      <div class='line'>For so it seemed, with purpose of its own</div>
      <div class='line'>And measured motion, like a living thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Strode after me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is the history of that other fearful
moment when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I heard among the solitary hills</div>
      <div class='line'>Low breathings coming after me, and sounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Of undistinguishable motion, steps</div>
      <div class='line'>Almost as silent as the turf they trod.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And there are other passages telling of nature
in less awful and menacing aspects, nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the giver of comfort and strong serenity.
Reading these we are able in some measure
to live for ourselves the emotions that were
Wordsworth’s. If we can feel his “shadowy
exaltations,” we have got all that
Wordsworth can give us. There is no need
to read the theology of his mysticism, the
pantheistic explanation of his emotions. To
Peter Bell a primrose by a river’s brim was
only a yellow primrose. Its beauty stirred
in him no feeling. But one can be moved
by the sight of the primrose without necessarily
thinking, in the words of Mr. Cobden-Sanderson’s
preface, of “the infinite tenderness
of the infinitely great, of the infinitely
great which, from out the infinite and amid
its own stupendous tasks, stoops to strew the
path of man, the infinitely little, with sunshine
and with flowers.” This is the theology
of our primrose emotion. But it is the
emotion itself which is important, not the
theology. The emotion has its own powerful
conduct value, whereas the philosophy
derived from it, suspiciously anthropocentric,
possesses, we should imagine, only the smallest
value as truth.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='23'>XXIII</abbr>: VERHAEREN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Verhaeren was one of those men who
feel all their life long “l’envie” (to
use his own admirably expressive phrase),
“l’envie de tailler en drapeaux l’étoffe de la
vie.” The stuff of life can be put to worse
uses. To cut it into flags is, on the whole,
more admirable than to cut it, shall we say,
into cerecloths, or money-bags, or Parisian
underclothing. A flag is a brave, a cheerful
and a noble object. These are qualities for
which we are prepared to forgive the flag its
over-emphasis, its lack of subtlety, its touch
of childishness. One can think of a number
of writers who have marched through literary
history like an army with banners. There
was Victor Hugo, for example—one of Verhaeren’s
admired masters. There was Balzac,
to whose views of life Verhaeren’s was,
in some points, curiously akin. Among the
minor makers of oriflammes there is our own
Mr. Chesterton, with his heroic air of being
for ever on the point of setting out on a crusade,
glorious with bunting and mounted on
a rocking-horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>The flag-maker is a man of energy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>strong vitality. He likes to imagine that all
that surrounds him is as large, as full of sap
and as vigorous as he feels himself to be. He
pictures the world as a place where the colours
are strong and brightly contrasted,
where a vigorous chiaroscuro leaves no doubt
as to the true nature of light and darkness,
and where all life pulsates, quivering and
taut, like a banner in the wind. From the
first we find in Verhaeren all the characteristics
of the tailor of banners. In his earliest
book of verse, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Flamands</span></i>, we see him already
delighting in such lines as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Leurs deux poings monstrueux pataugeaient dans la pâte.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Already too we find him making copious
use—or was it abuse?—as Victor Hugo had
done before him, of words like <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“vaste,”
“énorme,” “infini,” “infiniment,” “infinité,”
“univers.”</span> Thus, in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’Ame de la Ville,”</span> he
talks of an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“énorme”</span> viaduct, an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“immense”</span>
train, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“monstrueux”</span> sun, even of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“énorme”</span> atmosphere. For Verhaeren all
roads lead to the infinite, wherever and whatever
that may be.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les grand’routes tracent des croix</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’infini, à travers bois;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les grand’routes tracent des croix lointaines</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’infini, à travers plaines.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Infinity is one of those notions which are
not to be lightly played with. The makers
of flags like it because it can be contrasted
so effectively with the microscopic finitude
of man. Writers like Hugo and Verhaeren
talk so often and so easily about infinity that
the idea ceases in their poetry to have any
meaning at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have said that, in certain respects, Verhaeren,
in his view of life, is not unlike
Balzac. This resemblance is most marked
in some of the poems of his middle period,
especially those in which he deals with aspects
of contemporary life. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Villes tentaculaires</span></i>
contains poems which are wholly
Balzacian in conception. Take, for example,
Verhaeren’s rhapsody on the Stock Exchange:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une fureur réenflammée</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au mirage du moindre espoir</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a id='tnou'></a>Où l’on se bat, à coups de vols, en bas.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Langues sèches, regards aigus, gestes inverses,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et cervelles, qu’en tourbillons les millions traversent,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Echangent là leur peur et leur terreur ...</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aux fins de mois, quand les débâcles se décident</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La mort les paraphe de suicides,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais au jour même aux heures blêmes,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les volontés dans la fièvre revivent,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’acharnement sournois</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Reprend comme autrefois.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>One cannot read these lines without thinking
of Balzac’s feverish money-makers, of
the Baron de Nucingen, Du Tillet, the Kellers
and all the lesser misers and usurers, and
all their victims. With their worked-up and
rather melodramatic excitement, they breathe
the very spirit of Balzac’s prodigious film-scenario
version of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Verhaeren’s flag-making instinct led him
to take special delight in all that is more
than ordinarily large and strenuous. He extols
and magnifies the gross violence of the
Flemish peasantry, their almost infinite capacity
for taking food and drink, their industry,
their animalism. In true Rooseveltian
style, he admired energy for its own
sake. All his romping rhythms were dictated
to him by the need to express this passion for
the strenuous. His curious assonances and
alliterations—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Luttent et s’entrebuttent en disputes—</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>arise from this same desire to recapture the
sense of violence and immediate life.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to compare the violence
and energy of Verhaeren with the violence
of an earlier poet—Rimbaud, the marvellous
boy, if ever there was one. Rimbaud cut the
stuff of life into flags, but into flags that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>never fluttered on this earth. His violence
penetrated, in some sort, beyond the bounds
of ordinary life. In some of his poems Rimbaud
seems actually to have reached the
nameless goal towards which he was striving,
to have arrived at that world of unheard-of
spiritual vigour and beauty whose nature he
can only describe in an exclamatory metaphor:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Millions d’oiseaux d’or, ô future vigueur!</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But the vigour of Verhaeren is never anything
so fine and spiritual as this “million of
golden birds.” It is merely the vigour and
violence of ordinary life speeded up to cinema
intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a noticeable fact that Verhaeren was
generally at his best when he took a holiday
from the making and waving of flags. His
Flemish bucolics and the love poems of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Heures</span></i>, written for the most part in traditional
form, and for the most part shorter and
more concentrated than his poems of violence
and energy, remain the most moving portion
of his work. Very interesting, too, are the
poems belonging to that early phase of doubt
and depression which saw the publication of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Débâcles</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Flambeaux Noirs</span></i>. The
energy and life of the later books is there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>but in some sort concentrated, preserved and
intensified, because turned inwards upon itself.
Of many of the later poems one feels
that they were written much too easily.
These must have been brought very painfully
and laboriously to the birth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='24'>XXIV</abbr>: EDWARD LEAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are few writers whose works I
care to read more than once, and one
of them is certainly Edward Lear. Nonsense,
like poetry, to which it is closely allied,
like philosophic speculation, like every
product of the imagination, is an assertion
of man’s spiritual freedom in spite of all the
oppression of circumstance. As long as it
remains possible for the human mind to invent
the Quangle Wangle and the Fimble
Fowl, to wander at will over the Great
Gromboolian Plain and the hills of the
Cnankly Bore, the victory is ours. The existence
of nonsense is the nearest approach
to a proof of that unprovable article of faith,
whose truth we must all assume or perish
miserably: that life is worth living. It is
when circumstances combine to prove, with
syllogistic cogency, that life is not worth living
that I turn to Lear and find comfort and
refreshment. I read him and I perceive that
it is a good thing to be alive; for I am free,
with Lear, to be as inconsequent as I like.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lear is a genuine poet. For what is his
nonsense except the poetical imagination a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>little twisted out of its course? Lear had the
true poet’s feeling for words—words in themselves,
precious and melodious, like phrases
of music; personal as human beings. Marlowe
talks of entertaining divine Zenocrate;
Milton of the leaves that fall in Vallombrosa;
Lear of the Fimble Fowl with a corkscrew
leg, of runcible spoons, of things meloobious
and genteel. Lewis Carroll wrote
nonsense by exaggerating sense—a too logical
logic. His coinages of words are intellectual.
Lear, more characteristically a poet, wrote
nonsense that is an excess of imagination,
coined words for the sake of their colour and
sound alone. His is the purer nonsense, because
more poetical. Change the key ever so
little and the “Dong with a Luminous Nose”
would be one of the most memorable romantic
poems of the nineteenth century. Think,
too, of that exquisite “Yonghy Bonghy Bo”!
In one of Tennyson’s later volumes there is
a charming little lyric about Catullus, which
begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Row us out from Desenzano,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To your Sirmione row!</div>
      <div class='line'>So they row’d, and there we landed—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O venusta Sirmio!</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Can one doubt for a moment that he was
thinking, when he wrote these words, of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>superb stanza with which the “Yonghy
Bonghy” opens:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the coast of Coromandel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where the early pumpkins blow,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the middle of the woods,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dwelt the Yonghy Bonghy Bo.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Personally, I prefer Lear’s poem; it is the
richer and the fuller of the two.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lear’s genius is at its best in the Nonsense
Rhymes, or Limericks, as a later generation
has learned to call them. In these I like to
think of him not merely as a poet and a
draughtsman—and how unique an artist the
recent efforts of Mr. Nash to rival him have
only affirmed—but also as a profound social
philosopher. No study of Lear would
be complete without at least a few remarks
on “They” of the Nonsense Rhymes. “They”
are the world, the man in the street; “They”
are what the leader-writers in the twopenny
press would call all Right-Thinking Men and
Women; “They” are Public Opinion. The
Nonsense Rhymes are, for the most part,
nothing more nor less than episodes selected
from the history of that eternal struggle between
the genius or the eccentric and his
fellow-beings. Public Opinion universally
abhors eccentricity. There was, for example,
that charming Old Man of Melrose who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>walked on the tips of his toes. But “They”
said (with their usual inability to appreciate
the artist), “It ain’t pleasant to see you at
present, you stupid old man of Melrose.”
Occasionally, when the eccentric happens to
be a criminal genius, “They” are doubtless
right. The Old Man with a Gong who
bumped on it all the day long deserved to be
smashed. (But “They” also smashed a quite
innocuous Old Man of Whitehaven merely
for dancing a quadrille with a raven.) And
there was that Old Person of Buda, whose
conduct grew ruder and ruder; “They” were
justified, I dare say, in using a hammer to
silence his clamour. But it raises the whole
question of punishment and of the relation
between society and the individual.</p>

<p class='c013'>When “They” are not offensive, they content
themselves with being foolishly inquisitive.
Thus, “They” ask the Old Man of the
Wrekin whether his boots are made of
leather. “They” pester the Old Man in a
Tree with imbecile questions about the Bee
which so horribly bored him. In these encounters
the geniuses and the eccentrics often
get the better of the gross and heavy-witted
public. The Old Person of Ware who rode
on the back of a bear certainly scored off
“Them.” For when “They” asked: “Does
it trot?” He replied, “It does not.” (The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>picture shows it galloping <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ventre à terre</span></i>.)
“It’s a Moppsikon Floppsikon bear.” Sometimes,
too, the eccentric actually leads
“Them” on to their discomfiture. One
thinks of that Old Man in a Garden, who
always begged every one’s pardon. When
“They” asked him, “What for?” he replied,
“You’re a bore, and I trust you’ll go out of
my garden.” But “They” probably ended
up by smashing him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Occasionally the men of genius adopt a
Mallarméen policy. They flee from the gross
besetting crowd.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La chair est triste, hélas, et j’ai lu tous les livres.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fuir, là-bas, fuir....</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was surely with these words on his lips
that the Old Person of Bazing (whose presence
of mind, for all that he was a Symbolist,
was amazing) went out to purchase the steed
which he rode at full speed and escaped from
the people of Bazing. He chose the better
part; for it is almost impossible to please
the mob. The Old Person of Ealing was
thought by his suburban neighbours to be
almost devoid of good feeling, because, if
you please, he drove a small gig with three
owls and a pig. And there was that pathetic
Old Man of Thermopylæ (for whom I have
a peculiar sympathy, since he reminds me so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>poignantly of myself), who never did anything
properly. “They,” said, “If you choose
to boil eggs in your shoes, you shall never
remain in Thermopylæ.” The sort of people
“They” like do the stupidest things, have the
vulgarest accomplishments. Of the Old Person
of Filey his acquaintance was wont to
speak highly because he danced perfectly well
to the sound of a bell. And the people of
Shoreham adored that fellow-citizen of theirs
whose habits were marked by decorum and
who bought an umbrella and sate in the
cellar. Naturally; it was only to be expected.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='25'>XXV</abbr>: SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That an Englishman should be a very
great plastic artist is always rather
surprising. Perhaps it is a matter of mere
chance; perhaps it has something to do with
our national character—if such a thing
really exists. But, whatever may be the
cause, the fact remains that England has
produced very few artists of first-class importance.
The Renaissance, as it spread,
like some marvellous infectious disease of
the spirit, across the face of Europe, manifested
itself in different countries by different
symptoms. In Italy, the country of its
origin, the Renaissance was, more than anything,
an outburst of painting, architecture
and sculpture. Scholarship and religious
reformation were, in Germany, the typical
manifestations of the disease. But when
this gorgeous spiritual measles crossed the
English Channel, its symptoms were almost
exclusively literary. The first premonitory
touch of the infection from Italy
“brought out” Chaucer. With the next bout
of the disease England produced the Elizabethans.
But among all these poets there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>was not a single plastic artist whose name we
so much as remember.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, suddenly, the seventeenth century
gave birth to two English artists of
genius. It produced Inigo Jones and, a little
later, Wren. Wren died, at the age of more
than ninety, in the spring of 1723. We are
celebrating to-day his bi-centenary—celebrating
it not merely by antiquarian talk and
scholarly appreciations of his style but also
(the signs are not wanting) in a more concrete
and living way: by taking a renewed
interest in the art of which he was so great
a master and by reverting in our practice to
that fine tradition which he, with his predecessor,
Inigo, inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c013'>An anniversary celebration is an act of
what Wordsworth would have called “natural
piety”; an act by which past is linked
with present and of the vague, interminable
series of the days a single comprehensible and
logical unity is created in our minds. At the
coming of the centenaries we like to remember
the great men of the past, not so much
by way of historical exercise, but that we may
see precisely where, in relation to their
achievement, we stand at the present time,
that we may appraise the life still left in
their spirit and apply to ourselves the moral
of their example. I have no intention in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>article of giving a biography of Wren, a list
of his works, or a technical account of his
style and methods. I propose to do no more
than describe, in the most general terms, the
nature of his achievement and its significance
to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wren was a good architect. But since it
is important to know precisely what we are
talking about, let us begin by asking ourselves
what good architecture is. Descending
with majesty from his private Sinai, Mr.
Ruskin dictated to a whole generation of
Englishmen the æsthetic Law. On monolithic
tables that were the Stones of Venice
he wrote the great truths that had been revealed
to him. Here is one of them:</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>It is to be generally observed that the proportions
of buildings have nothing to do with the style or
general merit of their architecture. An architect
trained in the worst schools and utterly devoid of
all meaning or purpose in his work, may yet have
such a natural gift of massing and grouping as will
render his structure effective when seen at a distance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Now it is to be generally observed, as he
himself would say, that in all matters connected
with art, Ruskin is to be interpreted
as we interpret dreams—that is to say, as
signifying precisely the opposite of what he
says. Thus, when we find him saying that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>good architecture has nothing to do with proportion
or the judicious disposition of masses
and that the general effect counts for nothing
at all, we may take it as more or less definitely
proven that good architecture is, in fact, almost
entirely a matter of proportion and
massing, and that the general effect of the
whole work counts for nearly everything.
Interpreted according to this simple oneirocritical
method, Ruskin’s pontifical pronouncement
may be taken as explaining
briefly and clearly the secrets of good architecture.
That is why I have chosen this
quotation to be the text of my discourse on
Wren.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the qualities which most obviously
distinguish Wren’s work are precisely those
which Ruskin so contemptuously disparages
and which we, by our process of interpretation,
have singled out as the essentially
architectural qualities. In all that Wren designed—I
am speaking of the works of
his maturity; for at the beginning of his
career he was still an unpractised amateur,
and at the end, though still on occasion wonderfully
successful, a very old man—we see
a faultless proportion, a felicitous massing
and contrasting of forms. He conceived his
buildings as three-dimensional designs which
should be seen, from every point of view, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>harmoniously proportioned wholes. (With
regard to the exteriors this, of course, is true
only of those buildings which <i>can</i> be seen
from all sides. Like all true architects, Wren
preferred to build in positions where his
work could be appreciated three-dimensionally.
But he was also a wonderful maker
of façades; witness his Middle Temple gateway
and his houses in King’s Bench Walk.)
He possessed in the highest degree that instinctive
sense of proportion and scale which
enabled him to embody his conception in
brick and stone. In his great masterpiece
of St. Paul’s every part of the building, seen
from within or without, seems to stand in a
certain satisfying and harmonious relation to
every other part. The same is true even of
the smallest works belonging to the period of
Wren’s maturity. On its smaller scale and
different plane, such a building as Rochester
Guildhall is as beautiful, because as harmonious
in the relation of all its parts, as
St. Paul’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of Wren’s other purely architectural qualities
I shall speak but briefly. He was, to begin
with, an engineer of inexhaustible resource;
one who could always be relied upon
to find the best possible solution to any problem,
from blowing up the ruins of old St.
Paul’s to providing the new with a dome that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>should be at once beautiful and thoroughly
safe. As a designer he exhibited the same
practical ingenuity. No architect has known
how to make so much of a difficult site and
cheap materials. The man who built the
City churches was a practical genius of no
common order. He was also an artist of profoundly
original mind. This originality reveals
itself in the way in which he combines
the accepted features of classical Renaissance
architecture into new designs that were entirely
English and his own. The steeples of
his City churches provide us with an obvious
example of this originality. His domestic
architecture—that wonderful application of
classical principles to the best in the native
tradition—is another.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Wren’s most characteristic quality—the
quality which gives to his work, over
and above its pure beauty, its own peculiar
character and charm—is a quality rather
moral than æsthetic. Of Chelsea Hospital,
Carlyle once remarked that it was “obviously
the work of a gentleman.” The words
are illuminating. Everything that Wren did
was the work of a gentleman; that is the secret
of its peculiar character. For Wren was
a great gentleman: one who valued dignity
and restraint and who, respecting himself,
respected also humanity; one who desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that men and women should live with the
dignity, even the grandeur, befitting their
proud human title; one who despised meanness
and oddity as much as vulgar ostentation;
one who admired reason and order, who
distrusted all extravagance and excess. A
gentleman, the finished product of an old and
ordered civilization.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wren, the restrained and dignified gentleman,
stands out most clearly when we compare
him with his Italian contemporaries.
The baroque artists of the seventeenth century
were interested above everything in the
new, the startling, the astonishing; they
strained after impossible grandeurs, unheard-of
violences. The architectural ideals of
which they dreamed were more suitable for
embodiment in theatrical cardboard than in
stone. And indeed, the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth century was the golden age
of scene-painting in Italy. The artists who
painted the settings for the elder Scarlatti’s
operas, the later Bibienas and Piranesis,
came nearer to reaching the wild Italian ideal
than ever mere architects like Borromini or
Bernini, their imaginations cramped by the
stubbornness of stone and the unsleeping
activities of gravitations, could hope to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>How vastly different is the baroque theatricality
from Wren’s sober restraint! Wren
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>was a master of the grand style; but he never
dreamed of building for effect alone. He
was never theatrical or showy, never pretentious
or vulgar. St. Paul’s is a monument
of temperance and chastity. His great palace
at Hampton Court is no gaudy stage-setting
for the farce of absolute monarchy.
It is a country gentleman’s house—more spacious,
of course, and with statelier rooms
and more impressive vistas—but still a house
meant to be lived in by some one who was
a man as well as a king. But if his palaces
might have housed, without the least incongruity,
a well-bred gentleman, conversely his
common houses were always dignified enough,
however small, to be palaces in miniature
and the homes of kings.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the course of the two hundred years
which have elapsed since his death, Wren’s
successors have often departed, with melancholy
results, from the tradition of which he
was the founder. They have forgotten, in
their architecture, the art of being gentlemen.
Infected by a touch of the baroque
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">folie de grandeur</span></i>, the architects of the
eighteenth century built houses in imitation
of Versailles and Caserta—huge stage
houses, all for show and magnificence and all
but impossible to live in.</p>

<p class='c013'>The architects of the nineteenth century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>sinned in a diametrically opposite way—towards
meanness and a negation of art.
Senselessly preoccupied with details, they
created the nightmare architecture of “features.”
The sham Gothic of early Victorian
times yielded at the end of the century to
the nauseous affectation of “sham-peasantry.”
Big houses were built with all the
irregularity and more than the “quaintness”
of cottages; suburban villas took the form
of machine-made imitations of the Tudor
peasant’s hut. To all intents and purposes
architecture ceased to exist; Ruskin had triumphed.</p>

<p class='c013'>To-day, however, there are signs that
architecture is coming back to that sane and
dignified tradition of which Wren was the
great exponent. Architects are building
houses for gentlemen to live in. Let us hope
that they will continue to do so. There may
be sublimer types of men than the gentleman:
there are saints, for example, and the
great enthusiasts whose thoughts and actions
move the world. But for practical purposes
and in a civilized, orderly society, the gentleman
remains, after all, the ideal man. The
most profound religious emotions have been
expressed in Gothic architecture. Human
ambitions and aspirations have been most
colossally reflected by the Romans and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Italians of the baroque. But it is in England
that the golden mean of reasonableness and
decency—the practical philosophy of the
civilized man—has received its most elegant
and dignified expression. The old gentleman
who died two hundred years ago preached
on the subject of civilization a number of
sermons in stone. St. Paul’s and Greenwich,
Trinity Library and Hampton Court, Chelsea,
Kilmainham, Blackheath and Rochester,
St. Stephen’s, Wallbrook and St. Mary
Ab-church, Kensington orangery and Middle
Temple gateway—these are the titles of a
few of them. They have much, if we will
but study them, to teach us.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='26'>XXVI</abbr>: BEN JONSON<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It comes as something of a surprise to find
that the niche reserved for Ben Jonson
in the “English Men of Letters” series has
only now been filled. One expected somehow
that he would have been among the first
of the great ones to be enshrined; but no,
he has had a long time to wait; and Adam
Smith, and Sydney Smith, and Hazlitt, and
Fanny Burney have gone before him into the
temple of fame. Now, however, his monument
has at last been made, with Professor
Gregory Smith’s qualified version of “O rare
Ben Jonson!” duly and definitively carved
upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is it that makes us, almost as a
matter of course, number Ben Jonson among
the great? Why should we expect him to
be an early candidate for immortality, or
why, indeed, should he be admitted to the
“English Men of Letters” series at all?
These are difficult questions to answer; for
when we come to consider the matter we
find ourselves unable to give any very glowing
account of Ben or his greatness. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>hard to say that one likes his work; one cannot
honestly call him a good poet or a supreme
dramatist. And yet, unsympathetic
as he is, uninteresting as he often can be, we
still go on respecting and admiring him, because,
in spite of everything, we are conscious,
obscurely but certainly, that he was
a great man.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had little influence on his successors;
the comedy of humours died without any but
an abortive issue. Shadwell, the mountain-bellied
“Og, from a treason tavern rolling
home,” is not a disciple that any man would
have much pride in claiming. No raking up
of literary history will make Ben Jonson
great as a founder of a school or an inspirer
of others. His greatness is a greatness of
character. There is something almost alarming
in the spectacle of this formidable figure
advancing with tank-like irresistibility towards
the goal he had set himself to attain.
No sirens of romance can seduce him, no
shock of opposition unseat him in his career.
He proceeds along the course theoretically
mapped out at the inception of his literary
life, never deviating from this narrow way
till the very end—till the time when, in his
old age, he wrote that exquisite pastoral, <i>The
Sad Shepherd</i>, which is so complete and absolute
a denial of all his lifelong principles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>But <i>The Sad Shepherd</i> is a weakness, albeit
a triumphant weakness. Ben, as he liked to
look upon himself, as he has again and again
revealed himself to us, is the artist with principles,
protesting against the anarchic absence
of principle among the geniuses and
charlatans, the poets and ranters of his age.</p>

<div class='bq'>

<p class='c013'>The true artificer will not run away from nature
as he were afraid of her; or depart from life and
the likeness of truth; but speak to the capacity
of his hearers. And though his language differ
from the vulgar somewhat, it shall not fly from all
humanity, with the Tamerlanes and Tamer-Chams
of the late age, which had nothing in them but the
scenical strutting and furious vociferation to warrant
them to the ignorant gapers. He knows it is
his only art, so to carry it as none but artificers
perceive it. In the meantime, perhaps, he is called
barren, dull, lean, a poor writer, or by what contumelious
word can come in their cheeks, by these
men who without labour, judgment, knowledge, or
almost sense, are received or preferred before him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In these sentences from <i>Discoveries</i> Ben
Jonson paints his own picture—portrait of
the artist as a true artificer—setting forth,
in its most general form, and with no distracting
details of the humours or the moral
purpose of art, his own theory of the artist’s
true function and nature. Jonson’s theory
was no idle speculation, no mere thing of
words and air, but a creed, a principle, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>categorical imperative, conditioning and informing
his whole work. Any study of the
poet must, therefore, begin with the formulation
of his theory, and must go on, as Professor
Gregory Smith’s excellent essay does indeed
proceed, to show in detail how the
theory was applied and worked out in each
individual composition.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good deal of nonsense has been talked
at one time or another about artistic theories.
The artist is told that he should have no
theories, that he should warble native wood-notes
wild, that he should “sing,” be wholly
spontaneous, should starve his brain and cultivate
his heart and spleen; that an artistic
theory cramps the style, stops up the Helicons
of inspiration, and so on, and so on.
The foolish and sentimental conception of
the artist, to which these anti-intellectual
doctrines are a corollary, dates from the time
of romanticism and survives among the foolish
and sentimental of to-day. A consciously
practised theory of art has never spoiled a
good artist, has never dammed up inspiration,
but rather, and in most cases profitably,
canalized it. Even the Romantics had
theories and were wild and emotional on
principle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Theories are above all necessary at moments
when old traditions are breaking up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>when all is chaos and in flux. At such moments
an artist formulates his theory and
clings to it through thick and thin; clings
to it as the one firm raft of security in the
midst of the surrounding unrest. Thus,
when the neo-Classicism, of which Ben was
one of the remote ancestors, was crumbling
into the nothingness of <i>The Loves of the
Plants</i> and <i>The Triumphs of Temper</i>,
Wordsworth found salvation by the promulgation
of a new theory of poetry, which he
put into practice systematically and to the
verge of absurdity in <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Similarly
in the shipwreck of the old tradition of
painting we find the artists of the present
day clinging desperately to intellectual formulas
as their only hope in the chaos. The
only occasions, in fact, when the artist can
afford entirely to dispense with theory occur
in periods when a well-established tradition
reigns supreme and unquestioned. And then
the absence of theory is more apparent than
real; for the tradition in which he is working
is a theory, originally formulated by someone
else, which he accepts unconsciously and as
though it were the law of Nature itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The beginning of the seventeenth century
was not one of these periods of placidity and
calm acceptance. It was a moment of growth
and decay together, of fermentation. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>fabulous efflorescence of the Renaissance had
already grown rank. With that extravagance
of energy which characterized them in
all things, the Elizabethans had exaggerated
the traditions of their literature into insincerity.
All artistic traditions end, in due
course, by being reduced to the absurd; but
the Elizabethans crammed the growth and
decline of a century into a few years. One
after another they transfigured and then destroyed
every species of art they touched.
Euphuism, Petrarchism, Spenserism, the sonnet,
the drama—some lasted a little longer
than others, but they all exploded in the end,
these beautiful iridescent bubbles blown too
big by the enthusiasm of their makers.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in the midst of this unstable luxuriance
voices of protest were to be heard, reactions
against the main romantic current
were discernible. Each in his own way and
in his own sphere, Donne and Ben Jonson
protested aganst the exaggerations of the age.
At a time when sonneteers in legions were
quibbling about the blackness of their ladies’
eyes or the golden wires of their hair, when
Platonists protested in melodious chorus that
they were not in love with “red and white”
but with the ideal and divine beauty of which
peach-blossom complexions were but inadequate
shadows, at a time when love-poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>had become, with rare exceptions, fantastically
unreal, Donne called it back, a little
grossly perhaps, to facts with the dry remark:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Love’s not so pure and abstract as they use</div>
      <div class='line'>To say, who have no mistress but their muse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There have been poets who have written
more lyrically than Donne, more fervently
about certain amorous emotions, but not one
who has formulated so rational a philosophy
of love as a whole, who has seen all the facts
so clearly and judged them so soundly.
Donne laid down no literary theory. His
followers took from him all that was relatively
unimportant—the harshness, itself a
protest against Spenserian facility, the conceits,
the sensuality tempered by mysticism—but
the important and original quality of
Donne’s work, the psychological realism, they
could not, through sheer incapacity, transfer
into their own poetry. Donne’s immediate
influence was on the whole bad. Any influence
for good he may have had has been on
poets of a much later date.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other great literary Protestant of the
time was the curious subject of our examination,
Ben Jonson. Like Donne he was a
realist. He had no use for claptrap, or rant,
or romanticism. His aim was to give his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>audiences real facts flavoured with sound
morality. He failed to be a great realist,
partly because he lacked the imaginative insight
to perceive more than the most obvious
and superficial reality, and partly because he
was so much preoccupied with the sound
morality that he was prepared to sacrifice
truth to satire; so that in place of characters
he gives us humours, not minds, but personified
moral qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ben hated romanticism; for, whatever may
have been his bodily habits, however infinite
his capacity for drinking sack, he belonged
intellectually to the party of sobriety. In all
ages the drunks and the sobers have confronted
one another, each party loud in derision
and condemnation of the defects which
it observes in the other. “The Tamerlanes
and Tamer-Chams of the late age” accuse the
sober Ben of being “barren, dull, lean, a poor
writer.” Ben retorts that they “have nothing
in them but the scenical strutting and
furious vociferation to warrant them to the
ignorant gapers.” At another period it is
the Hernanis and the Rollas who reproach
that paragon of dryness, the almost fiendishly
sober Stendhal, with his grocer’s style.
Stendhal in his turn remarks: “En paraissant,
vers 1803, le <i>Génie</i> de Chateaubriand m’a
semblé ridicule.” And to-day? We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>our sobers and our drunks, our Hardy and
our Belloc, our Santayana and our Chesterton.
The distinction is eternally valid. Our
personal sympathies may lie with one or the
other; but it is obvious that we could dispense
with neither. Ben, then, was one of
the sobers, protesting with might and main
against the extravagant behaviour of the
drunks, an intellectual insisting that there
was no way of arriving at truth except by intellectual
processes, an apotheosis of the
Plain Man determined to stand no nonsense
about anything. Ben’s poetical achievement,
such as it is, is the achievement of one who
relied on no mysterious inspiration, but on
those solid qualities of sense, perseverance,
and sound judgment which any decent citizen
of a decent country may be expected to possess.
That he himself possessed, hidden
somewhere in the obscure crypts and recesses
of his mind, other rarer spiritual qualities is
proved by the existence of his additions to
<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>—if, indeed, they are
his, which there is no cogent reason to doubt—and
his last fragment of a masterpiece,
<i>The Sad Shepherd</i>. But these qualities, as
Professor Gregory Smith points out, he seems
deliberately to have suppressed; locked them
away, at the bidding of his imperious theory,
in the strange dark places from which, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>beginning and the very end of his career,
they emerged. He might have been a great
romantic, one of the sublime inebriates; he
chose rather to be classical and sober. Working
solely with the logical intellect and rejecting
as dangerous the aid of those uncontrolled
illogical elements of imagination, he
produced work that is in its own way excellent.
It is well-wrought, strong, heavy with
learning and what the Chaucerians would
call “high sentence.” The emotional intensity
and brevity excepted, it possesses all
the qualities of the French classical drama.
But the quality which characterizes the best
Elizabethan and indeed the best English
poetry of all periods, the power of moving
in two worlds at once, it lacks. Jonson, like
the French dramatists of the seventeenth
century, moves on a level, directly towards
some logical goal. The road over which his
great contemporaries take us is not level; it
is, as it were, tilted and uneven, so that as
we proceed along it we are momently shot
off at a tangent from the solid earth of
logical meaning into superior regions where
the intellectual laws of gravity have no control.
The mistake of Jonson and the classicists
in general consists in supposing that
nothing is of value that is not susceptible of
logical analysis; whereas the truth is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the greatest triumphs of art take place in a
world that is not wholly of the intellect, but
lies somewhere between it and the inenarrable,
but, to those who have penetrated it,
supremely real, world of the mystic. In his
fear and dislike of nonsense, Jonson put
away from himself not only the Tamer-Chams
and the fustian of the late age, but
also most of the beauty it had created.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the romantic emotions of his
predecessors and contemporaries Jonson
abandoned much of the characteristically
Elizabethan form of their poetry. That extraordinary
melodiousness which distinguishes
the Elizabethan lyric is not to be
found in any of Ben’s writing. The poems
by which we remember him—“Cynthia,”
“Drink to Me Only,” “It is Not Growing
Like a Tree”—are classically well made
(though the cavalier lyrists were to do better
in the same style); but it is not for any musical
qualities that we remember them. One
can understand Ben’s critical contempt for
those purely formal devices for producing
musical richness in which the Elizabethans
delighted.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Eyes, why did you bring unto me these graces,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grac’d to yield wonder out of her true measure,</div>

      <div class='line in8'>Module of pleasure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>The device is childish in its formality, the
words, in their obscurity, almost devoid of
significance. But what matter, since the
stanza is a triumph of sonorous beauty? The
Elizabethans devised many ingenuities of
this sort; the minor poets exploited them until
they became ridiculous; the major poets
employed them with greater discretion, playing
subtle variations (as in Shakespeare’s sonnets)
on the crude theme. When writers
had something to say, their thoughts, poured
into these copiously elaborate forms, were
moulded to the grandest, poetical eloquence.
A minor poet, like Lord Brooke, from whose
works we have just quoted a specimen of
pure formalism, could produce, in his moments
of inspiration, such magnificent lines
as:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The mind of Man is this world’s true dimension,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And knowledge is the measure of the mind;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>or these, of the nethermost hell:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A place there is upon no centre placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deepe under depthes, as farre as is the skie</div>
      <div class='line'>Above the earth; darke, infinitely spaced:</div>
      <div class='line'>Pluto the king, the kingdome, miserie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Even into comic poetry the Elizabethans imported
the grand manner. The anonymous
author of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Tee-hee, tee-hee! Oh sweet delight</div>
      <div class='line'>He tickles this age, who can</div>
      <div class='line'>Call Tullia’s ape a marmosite</div>
      <div class='line'>And Leda’s goose a swan,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>knew the secret of that rich, facile music
which all those who wrote in the grand
Elizabethan tradition could produce. Jonson,
like Donne, reacted against the facility
and floridity of this technique, but in a different
way. Donne’s protest took the form
of a conceited subtlety of thought combined
with a harshness of metre. Jonson’s classical
training inclined him towards clarity, solidity
of sense, and economy of form. He
stands, as a lyrist, half-way between the
Elizabethans and the cavalier song-writers;
he has broken away from the old tradition,
but has not yet made himself entirely at
home in the new. At the best he achieves a
minor perfection of point and neatness. At
the worst he falls into that dryness and dulness
with which he knew he could be reproached.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have seen from the passage concerning
the true artificer that Jonson fully realized
the risk he was running. He recurs
more than once in <i>Discoveries</i> to the same
theme, “Some men to avoid redundancy run
into that [a “thin, flagging, poor, starved”
style]; and while they strive to have no ill-blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>or juice, they lose their good.” The
good that Jonson lost was a great one. And
in the same way we see to-day how a fear of
becoming sentimental, or “chocolate-boxy,”
drives many of the younger poets and artists
to shrink from treating of the great emotions
or the obvious lavish beauty of the
earth. But to eschew a good because the
corruption of it is very bad is surely a sign
of weakness and a folly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having lost the realm of romantic beauty—lost
it deliberately and of set purpose—Ben
Jonson devoted the whole of his immense
energy to portraying and reforming
the ugly world of fact. But his reforming
satiric intentions interfered, as we have already
shown, with his realistic intentions,
and instead of recreating in his art the actual
world of men, he invented the wholly intellectual
and therefore wholly unreal universe
of Humours. It is an odd new world, amusing
to look at from the safe distance that
separates stage from stalls; but not a place
one could ever wish to live in—one’s neighbours,
fools, knaves, hypocrites, and bears
would make the most pleasing prospect intolerable.
And over it all is diffused the atmosphere
of Jonson’s humour. It is a curious
kind of humour, very different from anything
that passes under that name to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>from the humour of <i>Punch</i>, or <i>A Kiss for
Cinderella</i>. One has only to read <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Volpone</span></i>—or,
better still, go to see it when it is acted
this year by the Phœnix Society for the revival
of old plays—to realize that Ben’s conception
of a joke differed materially from
ours. Humour has never been the same
since Rousseau invented humanitarianism.
Syphilis and broken legs were still a great
deal more comic in Smollett’s day than in
our own. There is a cruelty, a heartlessness
about much of the older humour which is
sometimes shocking, sometimes, in its less extreme
forms, pleasantly astringent and stimulating
after the orgies of quaint pathos and
sentimental comedy in which we are nowadays
forced to indulge. There is not a
pathetic line in <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Volpone</span></i>; all the characters
are profoundly unpleasant, and the fun is
almost as grim as fun can be. Its heartlessness
is not the brilliant, cynical heartlessness
of the later Restoration comedy, but
something ponderous and vast. It reminds
us of one of those enormous, painful jokes
which fate sometimes plays on humanity.
There is no alleviation, no purging by pity
and terror. It requires a very hearty sense
of humour to digest it. We have reason to
admire our ancestors for their ability to enjoy
this kind of comedy as it should be enjoyed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>It would get very little appreciation
from a London audience of to-day.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the other comedies the fun is not so
grim; but there is a certain hardness and
brutality about them all—due, of course,
ultimately to the fact that the characters are
not human, but rather marionettes of wood
and metal that collide and belabour one another,
like the ferocious puppets of the Punch
and Judy show, without feeling the painfulness
of the proceeding. Shakespeare’s
comedy is not heartless, because the characters
are human and sensitive. Our modern
sentimentality is a corruption, a softening
of genuine humanity. We need a few more
Jonsons and Congreves, some more plays like
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Volpone</span></i>, or that inimitable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marriage à la
Mode</span></i> of Dryden, in which the curtain goes
up on a lady singing the outrageously cynical
song that begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why should a foolish marriage vow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That long ago was made,</div>
      <div class='line'>Constrain us to each other now</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When pleasure is decayed?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Too much heartlessness is intolerable (how
soon one turns, revolted, from the literature
of the Restoration!), but a little of it now
and then is bracing, a tonic for relaxed sensibilities.
A little ruthless laughter clears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the air as nothing else can do; it is good for
us, every now and then, to see our ideals
laughed at, our conception of nobility caricatured;
it is good for solemnity’s nose to be
tweaked, it is good for human pomposity to
be made to look mean and ridiculous. It
should be the great social function—as Marinetti
has pointed out—of the music halls,
to provide this cruel and unsparing laughter,
to make a buffoonery of all the solemnly accepted
grandeurs and nobilities. A good dose
of this mockery, administered twice a year at
the equinoxes, should purge our minds of
much waste matter, make nimble our spirits
and brighten the eye to look more clearly
and truthfully on the world about us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ben’s reduction of human beings to a series
of rather unpleasant Humours is sound and
medicinal. Humours do not, of course, exist
in actuality; they are true only as caricatures
are true. There are times when we
wonder whether a caricature is not, after all,
truer than a photograph; there are others
when it seems a stupid lie. But at all times
a caricature is disquieting; and it is very
good for most of us to be made uncomfortable.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'><abbr title='27'>XXVII</abbr>: CHAUCER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are few things more melancholy
than the spectacle of literary fossilization.
A great writer comes into being, lives,
labours and dies. Time passes; year by year
the sediment of muddy comment and criticism
thickens round the great man’s bones.
The sediment sets firm; what was once a living
organism becomes a thing of marble. On
the attainment of total fossilization the great
man has become a classic. It becomes increasingly
difficult for the members of each
succeeding generation to remember that the
stony objects which fill the museum cases
were once alive. It is often a work of considerable
labour to reconstruct the living animal
from the fossil shape. But the trouble
is generally worth taking. And in no case
is it more worth while than in Chaucer’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>With Chaucer the ordinary fossilizing
process, to which every classical author is
subject, has been complicated by the petrifaction
of his language. Five hundred years
have almost sufficed to turn the most living
of poets into a substitute on the modern sides
of schools for the mental gymnastic of Latin
and Greek. Prophetically, Chaucer saw the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>fate that awaited him and appealed against
his doom:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ye know eke that, in form of speech is change</div>
      <div class='line'>Within a thousand year, and wordes tho</div>
      <div class='line'>That hadden price, now wonder nice and strange</div>
      <div class='line'>Us thinketh them; and yet they spake them so,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sped as well in love as men now do.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The body of his poetry may have grown old,
but its spirit is still young and immortal.
To know that spirit—and not to know it is
to ignore something that is of unique importance
in the history of our literature—it is
necessary to make the effort of becoming familiar
with the body it informs and gives
life to. The antique language and versification,
so “wonder nice and strange” to our
ears, are obstacles in the path of most of
those who read for pleasure’s sake (not that
any reader worthy of the name ever reads
for anything else but pleasure); to the pedants
they are an end in themselves. Theirs
is the carcass, but not the soul. Between
those who are daunted by his superficial difficulties
and those who take too much delight
in them Chaucer finds but few sympathetic
readers. I hope in these pages to be able to
give a few of the reasons that make Chaucer
so well worth reading.</p>

<p class='c013'>Chaucer’s art is, by its very largeness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>objectiveness, extremely difficult to subject
to critical analysis. Confronted by it, Dryden
could only exclaim, “Here is God’s
plenty!”—and the exclamation proves, when
all is said, to be the most adequate and satisfying
of all criticisms. All that the critic
can hope to do is to expand and to illustrate
Dryden’s exemplary brevity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God’s plenty!”—the phrase is a peculiarly
happy one. It calls up a vision of the
prodigal earth, of harvest fields, of innumerable
beasts and birds, of teeming life. And
it is in the heart of this living and material
world of Nature that Chaucer lives. He is
the poet of earth, supremely content to walk,
desiring no wings. Many English poets have
loved the earth for the sake of something—a
dream, a reality, call it which you will—that
lies behind it. But there have been few,
and, except for Chaucer, no poets of greatness,
who have been in love with earth for its
own sake, with Nature in the sense of something
inevitably material, something that is
the opposite of the supernatural. Supreme
over everything in this world he sees the
natural order, the “law of kind,” as he calls
it. The teachings of most of the great prophets
and poets are simply protests against the
law of kind. Chaucer does not protest, he
accepts. It is precisely this acceptance that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>makes him unique among English poets. He
does not go to Nature as the symbol of some
further spiritual reality; hills, flowers, sea,
and clouds are not, for him, transparencies
through which the workings of a great soul
are visible. No, they are opaque; he likes
them for what they are, things pleasant and
beautiful, and not the less delicious because
they are definitely of the earth earthy. Human
beings, in the same way, he takes as he
finds, noble and beastish, but, on the whole,
wonderfully decent. He has none of that
strong ethical bias which is usually to be
found in the English mind. He is not horrified
by the behaviour of his fellow-beings,
and he has no desire to reform them. Their
characters, their motives interest him, and
he stands looking on at them, a happy spectator.
This serenity of detachment, this placid
acceptance of things and people as they are,
is emphasized if we compare the poetry of
Chaucer with that of his contemporary, Langland,
or whoever it was that wrote <i>Piers
Plowman</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The historians tell us that the later years
of the fourteenth century were among the
most disagreeable periods of our national history.
English prosperity was at a very low
ebb. The Black Death had exterminated
nearly a third of the working population of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the islands, a fact which, aggravated by the
frenzied legislation of the Government, had
led to the unprecedented labour troubles that
culminated in the peasants’ revolt. Clerical
corruption and lawlessness were rife. All
things considered, even our own age is preferable
to that in which Chaucer lived. Langland
does not spare denunciation; he is appalled
by the wickedness about him, scandalized
at the openly confessed vices that have
almost ceased to pay to virtue the tribute of
hypocrisy. Indignation is the inspiration of
<i>Piers Plowman</i>, the righteous indignation of
the prophet. But to read Chaucer one would
imagine that there was nothing in fourteenth-century
England to be indignant about. It
is true that the Pardoner, the Friar, the Shipman,
the Miller, and, in fact, most of the
Canterbury pilgrims are rogues and scoundrels;
but, then, they are such “merry harlots”
too. It is true that the Monk prefers
hunting to praying, that, in these latter days
when fairies are no more, “there is none other
incubus” but the friar, that “purse is the
Archdeacon’s hell,” and the Summoner a villain
of the first magnitude; but Chaucer can
only regard these things as primarily humorous.
The fact of people not practising what
they preach is an unfailing source of amusement
to him. Where Langland cries aloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>in anger, threatening the world with hell-fire,
Chaucer looks on and smiles. To the great
political crisis of his time he makes but one
reference, and that a comic one:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So hideous was the noyse, ah <i>benedicite</i>!</div>
      <div class='line'>Certes he Jakke Straw, and his meyné,</div>

      <div class='line'>Whan that they wolden eny Flemyng kille,</div>
      <div class='line'>As thilke day was mad upon the fox.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Peasants may revolt, priests break their
vows, lawyers lie and cheat, and the world
in general indulge its sensual appetites; why
try and prevent them, why protest? After
all, they are all simply being natural, they
are all following the law of kind. A reasonable
man, like himself, “flees fro the pres and
dwelles with soothfastnesse.” But reasonable
men are few, and it is the nature of human
beings to be the unreasonable sport of
instinct and passion, just as it is the nature
of the daisy to open its eye to the sun and of
the goldfinch to be a spritely and “gaylard”
creature. The law of kind has always and
in everything dominated; there is no rubbing
nature against the hair. For</p>

<p class='c013'>(As the story from which these lines are
quoted happens to be about an unfaithful
wife, it seems that, in making the female
sex immune from the action of the law
of kind, Chaucer is indulging a little in
irony.)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Nature, deplorable as some of its manifestations
may be, must always and inevitably
assert itself. The law of kind has power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>even over immortal souls. This fact is the
source of the poet’s constantly expressed dislike
of celibacy and asceticism. The doctrine
that upholds the superiority of the state of
virginity over that of wedlock is, to begin
with (he holds), a danger to the race. It encourages
a process which we may be permitted
to call dysgenics—the carrying on of the
species by the worst members. The Host’s
words to the Monk are memorable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Allas! why wearest thou so wide a cope?</div>
      <div class='line'>God give me sorwe! and I were a pope</div>
      <div class='line'>Nought only thou, but every mighty man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though he were shore brode upon his pan (head)</div>
      <div class='line'>Should han a wife; for all this world is lorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>Religioun hath take up all the corn</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tredyng, and we burel (humble) men ben shrimpes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of feble trees there cometh wrecchid impes.</div>
      <div class='line'>This maketh that our heires ben so sclendere</div>
      <div class='line'>And feble, that they may not wel engendre.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But it is not merely dangerous; it is anti-natural.
That is the theme of the Wife of
Bath’s Prologue. Counsels of perfection are
all very well when they are given to those</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The bulk of us must live as the law of kind
enjoins.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>It is characteristic of Chaucer’s conception
of the world, that the highest praise he can
bestow on anything is to assert of it, that it
possesses in the highest degree the qualities
of its own particular kind. Thus of Cressida
he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She was not with the least of her stature,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all her limbes so well answering</div>
      <div class='line'>Weren to womanhood, that creature</div>
      <div class='line'>Nas never lesse mannish in seeming.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The horse of brass in the <i>Squire’s Tale</i> is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So well proportioned to be strong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Right as it were a steed of Lombardye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thereto so <i>horsely</i> and so quick of eye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Everything that is perfect of its kind is admirable,
even though the kind may not be
an exalted one. It is, for instance, a joy to
see the way in which the Canon sweats:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A cloote-leaf (dock leaf) he had under his hood</div>
      <div class='line'>For sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.</div>
      <div class='line'>But it was joye for to see him sweat;</div>
      <div class='line'>His forehead dropped as a stillatorie</div>
      <div class='line'>Were full of plantain or of peritorie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Canon is supreme in the category of
sweaters, the very type and idea of perspiring
humanity; therefore he is admirable and joyous
to behold, even as a horse that is supremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>horsely or a woman less mannish
than anything one could imagine. In the
same way it is a delight to behold the Pardoner
preaching to the people. In its own
kind his charlatanism is perfect and deserves
admiration:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mine handes and my tonge gon so yerne,</div>
      <div class='line'>That it is joye to see my busynesse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This manner of saying of things that they
are joyous, or, very often, heavenly, is typical
of Chaucer. He looks out on the world
with a delight that never grows old or weary.
The sights and sounds of daily life, all the
lavish beauty of the earth fill him with a
pleasure which he can only express by calling
it a “joy” or a “heaven.” It “joye was to
see” Cressida and her maidens playing together;
and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So aungellyke was her native beauté</div>
      <div class='line'>That like a thing immortal seemede she,</div>
      <div class='line'>As doth an heavenish parfit creature.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The peacock has angel’s feathers; a girl’s
voice is heavenly to hear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Antigone the shene</div>
      <div class='line'>Gan on a Trojan song to singen clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That it an heaven was her voice to hear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>One could go on indefinitely multiplying
quotations that testify to Chaucer’s exquisite
sensibility to sensuous beauty and his immediate,
almost exclamatory response to it.
Above all, he is moved by the beauty of
“young, fresh folkes, he and she”; by the
grace and swiftness of living things, birds
and animals; by flowers and placid, luminous,
park-like landscapes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to note how frequently
Chaucer speaks of animals. Like many other
sages, he perceives that an animal is, in a
certain sense, more human in character than
a man. For an animal bears the same relation
to a man as a caricature to a portrait.
In a way a caricature is truer than a portrait.
It reveals all the weaknesses and absurdities
that flesh is heir to. The portrait brings out
the greatness and dignity of the spirit that
inhabits the often ridiculous flesh. It is not
merely that Chaucer has written regular
fables, though the <i>Nun’s Priest’s Tale</i> puts
him among the great fabulists of the world,
and there is also much definitely fabular
matter in the <i>Parliament of Fowls</i>. No, his
references to the beasts are not confined to
his animal stories alone; they are scattered
broadcast throughout his works. He relies
for much of his psychology and for much
of his most vivid description on the comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of man, in his character and appearance
(which with Chaucer are always indissolubly
blended), with the beasts. Take,
for example, that enchanting simile in which
Troilus, stubbornly anti-natural in refusing
to love as the law of kind enjoins him, is
compared to the corn-fed horse, who has to
be taught good behaviour and sound philosophy
under the whip:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As proude Bayard ginneth for to skip</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of the way, so pricketh him his corn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till he a lash have of the longe whip,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then thinketh he, “Though I prance all biforn,</div>
      <div class='line'>First in the trace, full fat and newe shorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet am I but an horse, and horses’ law</div>
      <div class='line'>I must endure and with my feeres draw.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Or, again, women with too pronounced a
taste for fine apparel are likened to the cat:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And if the cattes skin be sleek and gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>She will not dwell in housé half a day,</div>
      <div class='line'>But forth she will, ere any day be dawet</div>
      <div class='line'>To show her skin and gon a caterwrawet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In his descriptions of the personal appearance
of his characters Chaucer makes constant use
of animal characteristics. Human beings,
both beautiful and hideous, are largely described
in terms of animals. It is interesting
to see how often in that exquisite description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of Alisoun, the carpenter’s wife, Chaucer produces
his clearest and sharpest effects by a
reference to some beast or bird:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fair was this younge wife, and therewithal</div>
      <div class='line'>As any weasel her body gent and small ...</div>
      <div class='line'>But of her song it was as loud and yern</div>
      <div class='line'>As is the swallow chittering on a barn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thereto she coulde skip and make a game</div>
      <div class='line'>As any kid or calf following his dame.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her mouth was sweet as bragot is or meath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or hoard of apples, laid in hay or heath.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wincing she was, as is a jolly colt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long as a mast and upright as a bolt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Again and again in Chaucer’s poems do we
find such similitudes, and the result is always
a picture of extraordinary precision and
liveliness. Here, for example, are a few:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gaylard he was as goldfinch in the shaw,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>or,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Such glaring eyen had he as an hare;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>or,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As piled (bald) as an ape was his skull.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The self-indulgent friars are</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Like Jovinian,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fat as a whale, and walken as a swan.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The Pardoner describes his own preaching
in these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then pain I me to stretche forth my neck</div>
      <div class='line'>And east and west upon the people I beck,</div>
      <div class='line'>As doth a dove, sitting on a barn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Very often, too, Chaucer derives his happiest
metaphors from birds and beasts. Of Troy
in its misfortune and decline he says: Fortune</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gan pull away the feathers bright of Troy</div>
      <div class='line'>From day to day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Love-sick Troilus soliloquizes thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He said: “O fool, now art thou in the snare</div>
      <div class='line'>That whilom japedest at lovés pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now art thou hent, now gnaw thin owné chain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The metaphor of Troy’s bright feathers reminds
me of a very beautiful simile borrowed
from the life of the plants:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And as in winter leavés been bereft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each after other, till the tree be bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>So that there nis but bark and branches left,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lieth Troilus, bereft of each welfare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ybounden in the blacke bark of care.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And this, in turn, reminds me of that couplet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in which Chaucer compares a girl to a flowering
pear-tree:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She was well more blissful on to see</div>
      <div class='line'>Than is the newe parjonette tree.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Chaucer is as much at home among the stars
as he is among the birds and beasts and flowers
of earth. There are some literary men
of to-day who are not merely not ashamed
to confess their total ignorance of all facts of
a “scientific” order, but even make a boast
of it. Chaucer would have regarded such
persons with pity and contempt. His own
knowledge of astronomy was wide and exact.
Those whose education has been as horribly
imperfect as my own will always find some
difficulty in following him as he moves with
easy assurance through the heavens. Still,
it is possible without knowing any mathematics
to appreciate Chaucer’s descriptions
of the great pageant of the sun and stars as
they march in triumph from mansion to mansion
through the year. He does not always
trouble to take out his astrolabe and measure
the progress of “Phebus, with his rosy cart”;
he can record the god’s movements in more
general terms than may be understood even
by the literary man of nineteen hundred and
twenty-three. Here, for example, is a description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of “the colde frosty seisoun of
Decembre,” in which matters celestial and
earthly are mingled to make a picture of
extraordinary richness:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Phebus wox old and hewed like latoun,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in his hoté declinacioun</div>
      <div class='line'>Shone as the burned gold, with streames bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now in Capricorn adown he light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where as he shone full pale; I dare well sayn</div>
      <div class='line'>The bitter frostes with the sleet and rain</div>
      <div class='line'>Destroyed hath the green in every yerd.</div>
      <div class='line'>Janus sit by the fire with double beard,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drinketh of his bugle horn the wine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beforn him stont the brawn of tusked swine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And “<i>noel</i>” cryeth every lusty man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In astrology he does not seem to have believed.
The magnificent passage in the <i>Man
of Law’s Tale</i>, where it is said that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In the starres, clearer than is glass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is written, God wot, whoso can it read,</div>
      <div class='line'>The death of every man withouten drede,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>is balanced by the categorical statement
found in the scientific and educational treatise
on the astrolabe, that judicial astrology is
mere deceit.</p>

<p class='c013'>His scepticism with regard to astrology
is not surprising. Highly as he prizes authority,
he prefers the evidence of experience,
and where that evidence is lacking he is content
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>to profess a quiet agnosticism. His respect
for the law of kind is accompanied by
a complementary mistrust of all that does
not appear to belong to the natural order of
things. There are moments when he doubts
even the fundamental beliefs of the Church:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A thousand sythes have I herd men telle</div>
      <div class='line'>That there is joye in heaven and peyne in helle;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I accorde well that it be so.</div>
      <div class='line'>But natheless, this wot I well also</div>
      <div class='line'>That there is none that dwelleth in this countree</div>
      <div class='line'>That either hath in helle or heaven y-be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Of the fate of the spirit after death he speaks
in much the same style:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His spiryt changed was, and wente there</div>
      <div class='line'>As I came never, I cannot tellen where;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore I stint, I nam no divinistre;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of soules fynde I not in this registre,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne me list not th’ opiniouns to telle</div>
      <div class='line'>Of hem, though that they witten where they dwelle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He has no patience with superstitions. Belief
in dreams, in auguries, fear of the “ravenes
qualm or schrychynge of thise owles”
are all unbefitting to a self-respecting man:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To trowen on it bothe false and foul is;</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas, alas, so noble a creature</div>
      <div class='line'>As is a man shall dreaden such ordure!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>By an absurd pun he turns all Calchas’s
magic arts of prophecy to ridicule:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So when this Calkas knew by calkulynge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And eke by answer of this Apollo</div>
      <div class='line'>That Grekes sholden such a people bringe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through which that Troye muste ben fordo,</div>
      <div class='line'>He cast anon out of the town to go.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It would not be making a fanciful comparison
to say that Chaucer in many respects
resembles Anatole France. Both men possess
a profound love of this world for its
own sake, coupled with a profound and gentle
scepticism about all that lies beyond this
world. To both of them the lavish beauty
of Nature is a never-failing and all-sufficient
source of happiness. Neither of them are
ascetics; in pain and privation they see nothing
but evil. To both of them the notion
that self-denial and self-mortification are
necessarily righteous and productive of good
is wholly alien. Both of them are apostles of
sweetness and light, of humanity and reasonableness.
Unbounded tolerance of human
weakness and a pity, not the less sincere for
being a little ironical, characterize them both.
Deep knowledge of the evils and horrors of
this unintelligible world makes them all the
more attached to its kindly beauty. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>at least one important respect Chaucer shows
himself to be the greater, the completer
spirit. He possesses, what Anatole France
does not, an imaginative as well as an intellectual
comprehension of things. Faced by
the multitudinous variety of human character,
Anatole France exhibits a curious impotence
of imagination. He does not understand
characters in the sense that, say, Tolstoy
understands them; he cannot, by the
power of imagination, get inside them, become
what he contemplates. None of the
persons of his creation are complete characters;
they cannot be looked at from every
side; they are portrayed, as it were, in the
flat and not in three dimensions. But Chaucer
has the power of getting into someone
else’s character. His understanding of the
men and women of whom he writes is complete;
his slightest character sketches are always
solid and three-dimensional. The Prologue
to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, in which the
effects are almost entirely produced by the
description of external physical features, furnishes
us with the most obvious example of
his three-dimensional drawing. Or, again,
take that description in the Merchant’s tale
of old January and his young wife May after
their wedding night. It is wholly a description
of external details, yet the result is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>a superficial picture. We are given a glimpse
of the characters in their entirety:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thus laboureth he till that the day gan dawe.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then he taketh a sop in fine clarré,</div>
      <div class='line'>And upright in his bed then sitteth he.</div>
      <div class='line'>And after that he sang full loud and clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And kissed his wife and made wanton cheer.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was all coltish, full of ragerye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And full of jargon as a flecked pye.</div>
      <div class='line'>The slacké skin about his necké shaketh,</div>
      <div class='line'>While that he sang, so chanteth he and craketh.</div>
      <div class='line'>But God wot what that May thought in her heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>When she him saw up sitting in his shirt,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his night cap and with his necké lean;</div>
      <div class='line'>She praiseth not his playing worth a bean.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But these are all slight sketches. For full-length
portraits of character we must turn
to <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, a work which,
though it was written before the fullest maturity
of Chaucer’s powers, is in many ways
his most remarkable achievement, and one,
moreover, which has never been rivalled for
beauty and insight in the whole field of English
narrative poetry. When one sees with
what certainty and precision Chaucer describes
every movement of Cressida’s spirit
from the first movement she hears of Troilus’
love for her to the moment when she is unfaithful
to him, one can only wonder why the
novel of character should have been so slow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>to make its appearance. It was not until the
eighteenth century that narrative artists,
using prose as their medium instead of verse,
began to rediscover the secrets that were familiar
to Chaucer in the fourteenth.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Troilus and Cressida</i> was written, as we
have said, before Chaucer had learnt to make
the fullest use of his powers. In colouring
it is fainter, less sharp and brilliant than the
best of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. The character
studies are there, carefully and accurately
worked out; but we miss the bright vividness
of presentation with which Chaucer was to
endow his later art. The characters are all
alive and completely seen and understood.
But they move, as it were, behind a veil—the
veil of that poetic convention which had,
in the earliest poems, almost completely
shrouded Chaucer’s genius, and which, as he
grew up, as he adventured and discovered,
grew thinner and thinner, and finally vanished
like gauzy mist in the sunlight. When
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i> was written the mist
had not completely dissipated, and the figures
of his creation, complete in conception
and execution as they are, are seen a little
dimly because of the interposed veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only moment in the poem when
Chaucer’s insight seems to fail him is at the
very end; he has to account for Cressida’s unfaithfulness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and he is at a loss to know how
he shall do it. Shakespeare, when he re-handled
the theme, had no such difficulty.
His version of the story, planned on much
coarser lines than Chaucer’s, leads obviously
and inevitably to the fore-ordained conclusion;
his Cressida is a minx who simply lives
up to her character. What could be more
simple? But to Chaucer the problem is not
so simple. His Cressida is not a minx. From
the moment he first sets eyes on her Chaucer,
like his own unhappy Troilus, falls head over
ears in love. Beautiful, gentle, gay; possessing,
it is true, somewhat “tendre wittes,”
but making up for her lack of skill in ratiocination
by the “sudden avysements” of intuition;
vain, but not disagreeably so, of her
good looks and of her power over so great
and noble a knight as Troilus; slow to feel
love, but once she has yielded, rendering
back to Troilus passion for passion; in a
word, the “least mannish” of all possible
creatures—she is to Chaucer the ideal of
gracious and courtly womanhood. But, alas,
the old story tells us that Cressida jilted her
Troilus for that gross prize-fighter of a man,
Diomed. The woman whom Chaucer has
made his ideal proves to be no better than
she should be; there is a flaw in the crystal.
Chaucer is infinitely reluctant to admit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>fact. But the old story is specific in its statement;
indeed, its whole point consists in
Cressida’s infidelity. Called upon to explain
his heroine’s fall, Chaucer is completely at
a loss. He makes a few half-hearted attempts
to solve the problem, and then gives it
up, falling back on authority. The old clerks
say it was so, therefore it must be so, and
that’s that. The fact is that Chaucer pitched
his version of the story in a different key
from that which is found in the “olde bokes,”
with the result that the note on which he is
compelled by his respect for authority to
close is completely out of harmony with the
rest of the music. It is this that accounts
for the chief, and indeed the only, defect
of the poem—its hurried and boggled conclusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot leave Cressida without some mention
of the doom which was prepared for her
by one of Chaucer’s worthiest disciples, Robert
Henryson, in some ways the best of the
Scottish poets of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Shocked by the fact that, in
Chaucer’s poem, Cressida receives no punishment
for her infidelity, Henryson composed
a short sequel, <i>The Testament of Cresseid</i>,
to show that poetic justice was duly performed.
Diomed, we are told, grew weary as
soon as he had “all his appetyte and mair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>fulfillit on this fair ladie” and cast her off,
to become a common drab.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O fair Cresseid! the flour and <i>A per se</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Troy and Greece, how wast thow fortunait!</div>
      <div class='line'>To change in filth all thy feminitie</div>
      <div class='line'>And be with fleshly lust sa maculait,</div>
      <div class='line'>And go amang the Grekis, air and late</div>
      <div class='line'>So giglot-like.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In her misery she curses Venus and Cupid
for having caused her to love only to lead
her to this degradation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The seed of love was sowen in my face</div>
      <div class='line'>And ay grew green through your supply and grace.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now, alas! that seed with frost is slain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I fra lovers left, and all forlane.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In revenge Cupid and his mother summon
a council of gods and condemn the <i>A per se</i>
of Greece and Troy to be a hideous leper.
And so she goes forth with the other lepers,
armed with bowl and clapper, to beg her
bread. One day Troilus rides past the place
where she is sitting by the roadside near the
gates of Troy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then upon him she cast up both her een,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And with ane blenk it cam into his thocht,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he some time before her face had seen,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But she was in such plight he knew her nocht,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yet then her look into his mind it brocht</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>The sweet visage and amorous blenking</div>
      <div class='line'>Of fair Cresseid, one sometime his own darling.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He throws her an alms and the poor creature
dies. And so the moral sense is satisfied.
There is a good deal of superfluous mythology
and unnecessary verbiage in <i>The Testament
of Cresseid</i>, but the main lines of the
poem are firmly and powerfully drawn. Of
all the disciples of Chaucer, from Hoccleve
and the Monk of Bury down to Mr. Masefield,
Henryson may deservedly claim to
stand the highest.</p>
